        "description": "Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller, but even when he stays safely at home he can't contain his curiosity about the world around him. \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" is his quest to understand everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilisation - how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. The ultimate eye-opening journey through time and space, revealing the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.",

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.",

For seventy years, victory&#8212;rapid, spectacular victory&#8212;had seemed the birthright of the Persian Empire. In the space of a single generation, they had swept across the Near East, shattering ancient kingdoms, storming famous cities, putting together an empire which stretched from India to the shores of the Aegean. As a result of those conquests, Xerxes ruled as the most powerful man on the planet. Yet somehow, astonishingly, against the largest expeditionary force ever assembled, the Greeks of the mainland managed to hold out. The Persians were turned back. Greece remained free. Had the Greeks been defeated in the epochal naval battle at Salamis, not only would the West have lost its first struggle for independence and survival, but it is unlikely that there would ever have been such an entity as the West at all.",

The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 and the Iraq war? Or the convergence of technology and events that allowed India, China, and so many other countries to become part of the global supply chain for services and manufacturing, creating an explosion of wealth in the middle classes of the world's two biggest nations, giving them a huge new stake in the success of globalisation? And with this flattening' of the globe, which requires us to run faster in order to stay in one place, has the world got too small and too fast for human beings and their political systems to adjust in a stable manner?In this brilliant new book, the award-winning New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman demystifies the brave new world for readers, allowing them to make sense of the often bewildering global scene unfolding before their eyes. With his inimitable ability to translate complex foreign policy and economic issues, Friedman explains how the flattening of the world happened at the dawn of the 21st century; what it means to countries, companies, communities and individuals; and how governments and societies can, and must, adapt.",

Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare. ",

If so, you&#8217;ve come to the right book, mostly! In Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door&#8212;not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.This enhanced eBook includes an audio introduction from the author; audio commentary from Mindy&#8217;s friends, including The Office costar B. J. Novak and Parks and Recreation creator Michael Schur; bonus photos, including an exclusive &#8220;Avalanche of Awkwardness&#8221; slideshow of never-before-seen childhood photos with audio commentary; and four full chapters read by the author.",

But now Fuling is heading down a new path, and gradually, along with scores of other towns in this vast and ever-evolving country, it is becoming a place of change and vitality, tension and reform, disruption and growth. As the people of Fuling hold on to the China they know, they are also opening up and struggling to adapt to a world in which their fate is uncertain.",

One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as \"The Cost of Discipleship \"and \"Life Together,\" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.",

        "description": "In A Long Way Gone, Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found that he was capable of truly terrible acts. This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. Children have become soldiers of choice. In the more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated that there are some 300,000 child-soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived.",

Timothy Egan's critically acclaimed account rescues this iconic chapter of American history from the shadows in a tour de force of historical reportage. Following a dozen families and their communities through the rise and fall of the region, Egan tells of their desperate attempts to carry on through blinding black dust blizzards, crop failure, and the death of loved ones. Brilliantly capturing the terrifying drama of catastrophe, Egan does equal justice to the human characters who become his heroes, \"the stoic, long suffering men and women whose lives he opens up with urgency and respect\" (New York Times).",

        "description": "Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.",

In North America, his name still graces four counties, thirteen towns, a river, parks, bays, lakes, and mountains. His restless life was packed with adventure and discovery, whether he was climbing the highest volcanoes in the world or racing through anthrax-infected Siberia or translating his research into bestselling publications that changed science and thinking. Among Humboldt&#8217;s most revolutionary ideas was a radical vision of nature, that it is a complex and interconnected global force that does not exist for the use of humankind alone. ",

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.",

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors, yet her cells&#8212;taken without her knowledge&#8212;became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first &#8220;immortal&#8221; human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they&#8217;d weigh more than 50 million metric tons&#8212;as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb&#8217;s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.",

        "description": "'This was much more than a bunch of guys out on an exploring and collecting expedition. This was a military expedition into hostile territory'. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a pioneering voyage across the Great Plains and into the Rockies. It was completely uncharted territory; a wild, vast land ruled by the Indians. Charismatic and brave, Lewis was the perfect choice and he experienced the savage North American continent before any other white man. UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the tale of a hero, but it is also a tragedy. Lewis may have received a hero's welcome on his return to Washington in 1806, but his discoveries did not match the president's fantasies of sweeping, fertile plains ripe for the taking. Feeling the expedition had been a failure, Lewis took to drink and piled up debts. Full of colourful characters - Jefferson, the president obsessed with conquering the west; William Clark, the rugged frontiersman; Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition; Drouillard, the French-Indian hunter - this is one of the great adventure stories of all time and it shot to the top of the US bestseller charts. Drama, suspense, danger and diplomacy combine with romance and personal tragedy making UNDAUNTED COURAGE an outstanding work of scholarship and a thrilling adventure.",

        "description": "The acclaimed author of Troublesome Young Men reveals the behind-the-scenes story of how the United States forged its wartime alliance with Britain, told from the perspective of three key American players in London: Edward R. Murrow, the handsome, chain-smoking head of CBS News in Europe; Averell Harriman, the hard-driving millionaire who ran FDR&#8217;s Lend-Lease program in London; and John Gilbert Winant, the shy, idealistic U.S. ambassador to Britain. Each man formed close ties with Winston Churchill&#8212;so much so that all became romantically involved with members of the prime minister&#8217;s family. Drawing from a variety of primary sources, Lynne Olson skillfully depicts the dramatic personal journeys of these men who, determined to save Britain from Hitler, helped convince a cautious Franklin Roosevelt and reluctant American public to back the British at a critical time. Deeply human, brilliantly researched, and beautifully written, Citizens of London is a new triumph from an author swiftly becoming one of the finest in her field.",

Few places in America have felt the influence of #MeToo more intensely. Indeed, college campuses were in many ways the harbingers of #MeToo. Grigoriadis captures the nature of this cultural reckoning without shying away from its complexity. College women use fresh, smart methods to fight entrenched sexism and sexual assault even as they celebrate their own sexuality as never before. Many&#160;&#8220;woke&#8221; male students are more open to feminism than ever, while others perpetuate the cruelest misogyny.&#160;Coexisting uneasily, these students are nevertheless rewriting long-standing rules of sex and power from scratch.",

        "description": "When the San Jos mine collapsed outside of Copiap, Chile, in August 2010, it trapped thirty-three miners beneath thousands of feet of rock for a record-breaking sixty-nine days. Across the globe, we sat riveted to television and computer screens as journalists flocked to the Atacama desert. While we saw what transpired above ground during the grueling and protracted rescue, the story of the miners experiences below the earths surface and the lives that led them there hasn't been heard until now. In this master work of a Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist, Hctor Tobar gains exclusive access to the miners and their stories. The result is a miraculous and emotionally textured account of the thirty-three men who came to think of the San Jos&#233; mine as a kind of coffin, as a cave inflicting constant and thundering aural torment, and as a church where they sought redemption through prayer while the world watched from above. It offers an understanding of the families and personal histories that brought los 33 to the mine, and the mystical and spiritual elements that surrounded working in such a dangerous place.",

        "description": "Everything always catches up. \"The past is never dead. It's not even past.\" William Faulkner said it best. If he couldn't kill the past, Carmine St. Clair would live to punish himself for it and try to outrun it at the same time. Haunted by memories of a childhood stained with the so-called tough love of a God-lovin' alcoholic father and the inky residue of his own bigotry, the last 15 years are a blur of libations and amassing trophies, women and money. Carmine has spent his whole life distancing himself from his past, those crooked lines, the dusty red clay roads of the South. But when the winning streak ends and the phone rings, he ends up right back where he started: Eton, Georgia (population 318). When the walls he's built around himself crumble, Carmine finds love in everything he's tried to escape: a black woman, forgiveness, himself, and the past. As he tries to figure out what the past means, what it means to be good, and what the future holds, he'll have to decide between love and hate, darkness and light, and all the things in between. Sometimes you have to go back to where you started to learn the oldest lesson of all: you've got to let go of everything to gain it all. A story about love, about forgiveness, and about what it means to make a life worth living. Charming and deeply moving A Song for Carmine is a story that gives you something to leave with.",

        "description": "The Wall Street meltdown in 2008 brought the country to its knees, and spawned nationwide protests against the lack of regulation and oversight facing Wall Street. But the average American still fails to fully grasp what was&#8212;and still is&#8212;happening: that the inmates continue to run the asylum. Doyle has been tracking this story for years through his blog Sense on Cents, and exposes here how Wall Street, our politicians, and the regulators themselves have conspired for personal and industry-wide gains while failing to protect investors, consumers, and the American taxpayer. He details the corrupt nature of Wall Street's financial police, who are little more than meter maids imposing fines that amount to nothing more than a slap on the wrist. He exposes the revolving door of Wall Street, wherein the regulators are all former or future employees of the very firms they're tasked with overseeing, and how they routinely serve the interests of the industry itself rather than protecting investors and markets. Recent bombshells&#8212;such as multi-billion dollar trading losses at JP Morgan Chase, the manipulation of interest rates via the LIBOR scandal, and money laundering with North American drug cartels and rogue nations such as Iran&#8212;are symptomatic of this corrosive culture and the lack of trust and confidence in the system. As the big banks fight tooth and nail to avoid real reforms that would protect the economy, this book is a timely, important, and shocking look inside the Washington-Wall Street conspiracy crippling America and the global economy.",

        "description": "A Sweeping and Authoritative Look at the Changes that will Ignite the Economies of America and its Trading Partners-Bring on the Next Boom! In The Next Boom, Jack Plunkett, a widely followed analyst of global trends, persuasively demonstrates that we are on the verge of a period of major economic growth. He presents a panorama of carefully documented developments in areas including energy, health care, education, demographics, global trade, evolving consumer habits, technologies and the rapidly-growing global middle class-showing how trends in America and around the world have tremendous synergy that will lead to a long-term surge in global business. Plunkett supports his theory through an entertaining analysis of global prospects for what he defines as the \"near future,\" from 2013-2025. The Next Boom, with its powerful and optimistic vision of the surprising changes ahead, arrives at a timely juncture, when confidence needs a vital boost in America and in the world's major business centers. Optimistic, provocative and far-reaching, the author demonstrates how The Next Boom and its underlying causes will have a deep, evolutionary effect on all of us. America is one of few nations with a rapidly growing population-Plunkett shows how this is a tremendous advantage. Meanwhile, the next billion consumers will soon emerge on a worldwide basis. The author shows how and why this will vastly increase demand for goods and services, attracting ever-greater innovation and competition among entrepreneurs and corporations. Plunkett is not suggesting that you look at the world through rose-colored glasses. Instead, he believes that you will benefit most from the state of the world today by understanding the changes that are occurring around you in order to prepare yourself for The Next Boom. This Book Shows What You Absolutely, Positively Have to Know about the Near Future The Next Boom is coming, and it will be an exciting period of solid global growth that will create immense opportunities for investment, business formation, innovation and job creation. The information provided in The Next Boom is vital to investors, managers, consultants, leaders in government and educators. This book will help you understand how to best position your business, your investments and your career to benefit from the coming era of global growth.",

        "description": "In 2009, T McKinley's brother committed suicide, and his first question to himself was why he hadn't done the same. In this moving and poignant memoir, McKinley takes the reader back through the events that led to a lifelong struggle with depression, shame, and inadequacy. Beginning with his own conception and birth and continuing through his parents' divorce and the fragmentation of his family, McKinley traces the origins and evolution of his deep-seated belief that everyone would have been better off if he had never existed at all. In this way, McKinley blamed, rejected, and buried his inner child, setting himself up for a lifetime of disconnection and depression. Years later, McKinley married, had two children, and soon saw that he was repeating the same toxic patterns that defined his own childhood. His feelings of hopelessness continued to increase until the family bought a fixer-upper house in suburban Virginia. As they sifted through the rubble of the dysfunctional family that had come before, McKinley was brought face-to-face with the pain that had buried him for far too long. He began to realize his own value to his family and reconnect with his own childhood-and the innocent child he had once been-in a more compassionate and loving way. He realized he was not broken, but that he did need to ask for help. Ultimately, through this experience, McKinley was able to find the hope that his brother never could. McKinley approaches difficult subjects with insight and humor, in a direct and disarming way. Readers are invited to approach their own issues with shame and depression with compassion instead of fear, and to confront their own patterns of disconnection and isolation with hope instead of powerlessness. McKinley had contemplated suicide often, but he learned that sometimes the greatest strength comes from admitting you need help. T. McKinley has an undergraduate degree in religious studies and a master's degree in folklore. He has worked a variety of jobs in his life, including short-order cook, towel boy at a YMCA, sperm donor, bartender, and professional cartoonist, and he spent six years working as a stand-up comic in Los Angeles. For the past eighteen years, he has taught English and theater in a variety of private middle and high schools. He is a suicide survivor who is happily married with two children.",

She sought acceptance in this patriarchal world, even at the cost of her passions and ambitions. In 2014, her father gifted her a book by Sheryl Sandberg, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. After reading it, she started a Lean In Circle. As she began leading a circle, she started leading her life, and observed a significant change in her confidence and self-esteem, and was on the path of discovering herself, spreading awareness and making a change in small ways. In this book, Sanya refers to patriarchy as a bug in human minds, which grows with age. She talks about how the Indian media, film industry, rituals and customs strengthen the bug; the effects of &#8216;Log Kya Kahenge&#8217; Syndrome on gender roles; and how unsafe cities become a psychological barrier for women. The book aims to encourage women in every part of the country to come together and fight gender inequality. Lean In India is an independent organization, affiliated with Lean In. Org, which works closely with Lean In. Org to further its mission, and is licensed by LeanIn. Org to use the &#8216;Lean In&#8217; name.",

        "description": "How would you like to be given a new identity to live by and then removed from your sisters and brothers--never to be permitted to ever contact them again--even upon your death bed? This is just one of many governmental red tape adoptees are forced to contend with because of adoption. Gain a bird's-eye view on the hidden side of the practice here! The findings have been called mind-blowing by adoptees and non-adoptees alike. Discover the history of adoption in a condensed book meant to help you see the topic in an organized manner. This research book has been divided into four short easy to read sections: revealing the making of the system throughout time starting from Europe, America, Asia and today finally in Africa. It is a must read for academics studying the field, and particularly useful for social workers, counselors, anthropologists, human rights advocates and adoptee allies. Pick up this book today and be one of the rare few who know more than the professionals profiting from the field.This research book summarizes the inception and expansion of the adoption industry, focusing on its roots and consequences kept from public awareness. For years, facilitators have denied adoptees access to documents that could lead them back to their families. In defense of the rights of adopted people, a true Ethiopian orphan briefly speaks her mind about adoption. Then, going back in time, the attention shifts from African adoptions (what's been trending) to the 1954 Evangelical Baby \"Swoop\" Era, to the 1854 Orphan Train Movement, and finally to the European Child Migration Schemes. Adoption History 101: An Orphan's Research supports those who have ever felt isolated due to the industry's privacy and lack of transparency. Taken children--now adults--are critiquing a global man-made market. This orphan's perspective is meant to inform vulnerable communities against a fierce industry that professes God is on their side. It is only natural for Mother-Nature to recover itself. This research is motivated by a Haitian adoptee who died of heart failure after learning that he had been trafficked to France for overseas adoption but was never able to acquire justice due to the public's love affair with the practice. This short book deconstructs the industry and acknowledges the families left behind. Has the global push for adoption exploited mothers worldwide?",

        "description": "Me, the Boy, and The Monster is a personal, thoughtful, and touching tribute to a family&#8217;s journey through the world of adoption and trauma. McGill has a background in developmental psychology and uses this to great effect; the theory sections of MTBTM are relevant, researched, and related to real-life examples from McGill&#8217;s own experience with her adopted son. This book goes beyond the tired clich&#233; of &#8216;attachment&#8217; however, pulling together relevant strands of many different psychological theories and disciplines, all of which is juxtaposed against heart-wrenching and emotional accounts taken from McGill&#8217;s own blog, giving the reader a unique and personal insight in to the day to day struggles of her family.

        "description": "All that is big, is made from small. If we ignore what is small, we ignore what is fundamental. What are we than left with? In terms of importance, nothing is bigger than the smallest. We tend to forget how important the small parts are. They are at the bottom. The lowest levels. They form the foundations for all structures above them. Imagine you start to dig under your house. One grain of sand at the time. At some point, when we take another grain of sand, the house will collapse. Our lives are made of small parts. We should perhaps care more for what is small, than for what is big. Observe our smallest daily choices. Understand why you decided for one over the other. The people that are small, forgotten, at the low end of life; need us more. They are the smallest building blocks of our society, of our lives; of our future. We cannot afford to give more attention to those that need it less. We should seek to befriend the smallest ones. The ones that are cast away. It is not a job for someone else. In every life, there should exist a humble service to those that the world finds unworthy. To those that are in some social way beneath us. It is our responsibility to lift them. To help them get up. To rise the fallen. And that can only be done by being smaller. By being under their feet, so that they may climb. Who is at the lowest possible level? At the bottom of this hierarchy lies perfection. Lies freedom. The greatest act of a man is serving. We are here to serve. Not so much to those bigger than us, but to those that are smaller. Look at the world. How little of this you will find. The world will convince you to go in the opposite direction. Partake in a race to the top. But the true race is to the bottom. When a king disguises as a peasant, to heal the wounds of the sick and forgotten. This my friend, is the narrow path. This is the crossroads",

        "description": "Over the last decade, the United States' position as the world's most powerful state has appeared increasingly unstable. The US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, non-traditional security threats, global economic instability, the apparent spread of authoritarianism and illiberal politics, together with the rise of emerging powers from the Global South have led many to predict the end of Western dominance on the global stage. This book brings together scholars from international relations, economics, history, sociology and area studies to debate the future of US leadership in the international system. The book&#160;analyses the past, present and future of US hegemony in key regions&#160;in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, Europe and Africa&#160;&#8211; while also examining the dynamic interactions of US hegemony with other established, rising and re-emerging powers such as Russia, China, Japan, India, Turkey and South Africa.

She did survive for almost 20 years after her first symptoms appeared although at the time, we did not know that they were cancer symptoms.It is not medical advice, just a simple exposure to what might make a difference in your choices in fighting cancer and possibly autoimmune disorders.This book discuses a number of things that can affect the outcome of your cancer struggle as well as some things that might even prevent cancer in the first place. There are places and people around the world where cancer is rare, practically non-existent. There are other thing s that increase not only your risk of developing cancer, but can also increases its rate of growth as well as helping it to spread in your body.This book is not about traditional cancer treatment because that is the realm of medical practice. It is about why cancer develops, why it spreads, and what you can do to reduce the risk, presence, and spread of cancer.",

        "description": "In these uncertain times engulfed by clouds of doubts, suspicion, panic, lack of scientific and logical thinking, and inability to plan even for the near future, I have opted to decipher some haunting mysteries, de-obscure the overall foggy situation, and disengage the alleged conflict between science and quackery. Although we are still in the \"crawling\" stage to come at grips with the virus, we have a thousand-year repertoire of common sense, hundreds of years of development in preserving public health, and decades of evidence-based medicine. This book simplifies scientific terminology for the non-specialist reader. It succinctly focuses on straightforward practical information: no profuse introductions, no enigmatic theories, and no boring details that may repel you, unnecessarily prolong the book, or restrict the required diversity to review all aspects of dealing with the pandemic in everyday life. In terms of references and sources, I often refer to verified and credible general media sources rather than specialized references. This is to facilitate cross-reference by the reader and go through the same language and terms the general public understand. As healthcare professionals, we are both debtors and creditors. We owe it to all humankind to guide them in terms of awareness, education, care, treatment, and scientific research during this dreaded pandemic. However, they also owe us to listen to what we say, read what we write, and trust us. They should not surrender their ears, eyes, and minds to the mongers of deceit, addicts to conspiracy theories, idiots of limited intelligence, and advocates of political and commercial agendas that run counter to professionalism, knowledge, honesty, and credibility.",

For most scientists and laypeople, it is axiomatic that something in the substance of the brain &#8212; neurons, synapses and gray matter in just the right combination &#8212; create perception, self-awareness, and intentionality.

This is no accident, as the authors of this book argue, given that the evidence increasingly points to a startling fact: consciousness may not, in fact, reside in the brain at all.",

Yet, as Ronen Bergman's groundbreaking reporting in this vital investigative history reveals, for thirty years, Iran has been the world's leading sponsor of global terror and stands as the most formidable sponsor of terror in the world today. Bergman, one of Israel's top investigative reporters, gained unprecedented access to extra-ordinary sources from top to bottom in the Mossad and intelligence agencies around the world. Based on over ten years of research and more than three hundred exclusive interviews with key intelligence figures, he reveals that Iranian terrorist masterminds have crisscrossed the globe, conducting bombings and assassinations with impunity -- even renting apartments and planning bombing attacks in New York City. Iran's proxy, Hizballah, has virtually taken over southern Lebanon and threatens Israel with high-powered weaponry supplied by Iran. Iran and Hizballah worked closely with al-Qaeda and other Sunni terrorist groups in developing their terrorist operations, and Iranian commandos trained Iraqi insurgents in the crafts of suicide bombing and the building of the roadside bombs that have killed so many U.S. troops in Iraq. In response, and largely beneath the public's radar, a vast clandestine war has been fought with Iran and Hizballah on one side and the CIA, Israel's Mossad, and their European counterparts on the other. The full story of that secret war, told for the first time here, will fundamentally change the debate about U.S. national security priorities. A new axis of evil is emerging from Iran and spreading around the world, and Ronen Bergman shows that the CIA and Mossad have so far been unable to thwart it. The Secret War with Iran is riveting and urgent.",

The atomic weapons test series wreaked havoc on Indigenous communities and turned the land into a radioactive wasteland. In 1950 Australian prime minister Robert Menzies blithely agreed to atomic tests that offered no benefit to Australia and relinquished control over them &#8211; and left the public completely in the dark. This book reveals the devastating consequences of that decision. This book is the most comprehensive account of the whole saga, from the time that the explosive potential of splitting uranium atoms was discovered, to the uncovering of the extensive secrecy around the British tests in Australia many years after the British had departed, leaving an unholy mess behind.",

        "description": "Pounamu is the beautiful green stone that traditionally served Maori as tool, weapon, adornment and currency. More recently it has been the subject of dispute between Ngai Tahu and the Crown. That dispute was settled with the return of the resource to Ngai Tahu in 1997. Under Ngai Tahu, a long term management programme is now in place that includes research into all aspects of the stone. The initial results of this research, conducted by Russell Beck and Maika Mason, are incorporated in this book. Other aspects, such as origins and natural occurrence, names and varieties, human history, both Maori and Pakeha, Maori myths and legends associated with pounamu, physical properties and the methods evolved for processing and carving it are also discussed. This book looks at jade in all its aspects. For carvers, jewellers, rockhounds and students it will be invaluable -- and for all those who are interested in New Zealand's history, it tells a turbulent and fascinating story. Mana Pounamu is the fully revised and updated edition of New Zealand Jade, first published in 1984.",

It was only after an intervention staged by family and friends, in response to frequent blackouts and episodic rages assumed to be alcohol-driven, that he sought treatment with Dr. Jeffery Smith; the first of his eleven personalities emerged in a session in 1990. After years of treatment, he has integrated them into three: Robert, Wanda, and Bobby, who take turns narrating this remarkable, unprecedented chronicle.",

As soon as men began writing they made Helen of Troy their subject. For close to 3000 years she's been both the embodiment of absolute female beauty & a reminder of the terrible power beauty can wield. Because of her double marriage to the Greek king Menelaus & the Trojan prince Paris, Helen was held responsible for enmity between East & West.

Polk was elected president in 1844, the United States was locked in a bitter diplomatic struggle with Britain over the rich lands of the Oregon Territory, which included what is now Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Texas, not yet part of the Union, was threatened by a more powerful Mexico. And the territories north and west of Texas -- what would become California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and part of Colorado -- belonged to Mexico. When Polk relinquished office four years later, the country had grown by more than a third as all these lands were added. The continental United States, as we know it today, was established -- facing two oceans and positioned to dominate both. ",

        "description": "The riveting story of the two crusading lawyers who led the legal battle to end segregation, one case and one courtroom at a time. The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education is widely considered a seminal point in the battle to end segregation, but it was in fact the culmination of a decades-long legal campaign. Root and Branch is the epic story of the two fiercely dedicated lawyers who led the fight from county courthouses to the marble halls of the Supreme Court, and, in the process, laid the legal foundations of the civil rights movement. Charles Hamilton Houston was the pioneer: After becoming the first African-American on the Harvard Law Review, he transformed the law school at all-black Howard University into a West Point for civil rights advocacy. One of Houston's students at Howard was a brash young man named Thurgood Marshall. Soon after Marshall's graduation, Houston and Marshall opened the NAACP's legal office. The abstemious, proper Houston and the folksy, easygoing Marshall made an unlikely duo, but together they faced down angry Southern mobs, negotiated with presidents and senators, and convinced even racist judges and juries that the Constitution demanded equal justice under law for all American citizens. Houston, tragically, would die before his strategy came to fruition in the Brown suit, but Marshall would argue the case victoriously and go on to become the first African-American Supreme Court justice--always crediting his mentor for teaching him everything he knew. Together, the two advocates changed the course of American history.",

        "description": "On September 1, 1894, two forest fires converged on the town of Hinckley, Minnesota, trapping more than two thousand people. The fire created its own weather, including hurricane-strength winds, bubbles of plasma-like glowing gas, and 200-foot-tall flames. As temperatures reached 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit, the firestorm knocked down buildings and carried flaming debris high into the sky. Two trains-one with every single car on fire-became the only means of escape. In all, more than four hundred people would die, leading to a revolution in forestry management and the birth of federal agencies that monitor and fight wildfires. A spellbinding account of danger, devastation, and courage, Under a Flaming Sky reveals the dramatic, minute-by-minute story of the tragedy and brings into focus the ordinary citizens whose lives it irrevocably marked.",

His findings will be of strong interest to scholars, politicians, and policymakers of South Asia, but the implications of his study have theoretical and practical relevance for a broad range of multiethnic societies in other areas of the world as well.",

Through the prisms of archeology, theology, and evolutionary psychology, Wright's findings overturn basic assumptions about Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and are sure to cause controversy. He explains why spirituality has a role today and why science, contrary to conventional wisdom, affirms the validity of the religious quest. And this previously unrecognized evolutionary logic points not toward continued religious extremism but to future harmony.",

Yet, as bestselling biographer Sarah Bradford reveals in this breathtaking new portrait, the truth is far more fascinating than the myth. Neither a vicious monster nor a seductive pawn, Lucrezia Borgia was a shrewd, determined woman who used her beauty and intelligence to secure a key role in the political struggles of her day.Drawing from a trove of contemporary documents and fascinating firsthand accounts, Bradford brings to life the art, the pageantry, and the dangerous politics of the Renaissance world Lucrezia Borgia helped to create.",

        "description": "Award-winning author Amy Stewart takes readers on an around-the-world, behind-the-scenes look at the flower industry and how it has sought&#8212;for better or worse&#8212;to achieve perfection. She tracks down the hybridizers, geneticists, farmers, and florists working to invent, manufacture, and sell flowers that are bigger, brighter, and sturdier than anything nature can provide. There's a scientist intent on developing the first genetically modified blue rose; an eccentric horitcultural legend who created the most popular lily; a breeder of gerberas of every color imaginable; and an Ecuadorean farmer growing exquisite roses, the floral equivalent of a Tiffany diamond. And, at every turn she discovers the startling intersection of nature and technology, of sentiment and commerce.",

        "description": "A pithy polemic bolstered by solid research, intellectual heft, and firsthand reporting, this is a book poised to change the debate over reproductive rights in this country wholesale. As activist and writer Cristina Page shows, the gains made by birth-control advocates (historically) and pro-choice organizations (currently) have formed the bedrock of freedoms few Americans would choose to live without. Now, not only is the future of legal abortion far from guaranteed, in many parts of the country ready access to many forms of contraception is in jeopardy as well. And that development, Page argues, should have everyone, regardless of moral or political persuasion, deeply concerned. For these basic freedoms are not just for the freewheeling gals of \"Sex and the City,\" but are central to the lives of working mothers and fathers from Phoenix to Duluth, churchgoers and nonbelievers alike. Page crystallizes the thoughts and attitudes of a generation of women and men whose voices are seldom heard in the political arena. ",

        "description": "The Sand Creek battle (or massacre) occurred on November 29-30, 1864, a confrontation between Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians and Colorado volunteer soldiers. The affair was a tragic event in American history, and what occurred there continues to be hotly contested. Indeed, labeling it a \"battle\" or a \"massacre\" will likely start an argument before any discussion on the merits begin. Even questions about who owns the story, or how it should be told, are up for debate. Three hearings were conducted about the Sand Creek affair, and there seems to be an overabundance of evidence from which to answer just about anything relating to the subject. Unfortunately, the available documentation only muddies the issues. Were the Indians peaceful? Did they hold white prisoners? Were they under army protection when the fighting took place? Were excessive numbers of women and children killed, and were bodies mutilated? Did the Indians fly an American flag? Did the chiefs die stoically in front of their tipis? Were white scalps found in the village? Gregory Michno candidly addresses these and other issues in The Three Battles of Sand Creek. The award-winning Indian Wars author divides his unique study into three sections. The first, \"In Blood,\" details the events of November 29-30, 1864, in what is surely the most comprehensive account published to date. The second section, \"In Court,\" focuses on the three investigations into the affair, illustrates some of the biases involved, and presents some of the contradictory testimony. The third and final section, \"The End of History,\" demonstrates the utter impossibility of sorting fact from fiction. Using Sand Creek as well as contemporary examples, Michno examines the evidence of eyewitnesses--all of whom were subject to false memories, implanted memories, leading questions, prejudice, self-interest, motivated reasoning, social, cultural, and political mores, an overactive amygdala, and a brain that had a \"mind\" of its own--obstacles that make factual accuracy an illusion. Living in a postmodern world of relativism suggests that all history is subject to the fancies and foibles of individual bias. The example of Sand Creek illustrates why we may be witnessing what Michno calls \"the end of history.\" Michno's extensive research includes primary and select secondary studies, including recollections, archival accounts, newspapers, diaries, and other original records. The Three Battles of Sand Creek will take its place as the definitive account of this previously misunderstood, and tragic, event.",

        "description": "Combining historical analysis with contemporary observation, Susan Jacoby dissects a new American cultural phenomenon&#8212;one that is at odds with our heritage of Enlightenment reason and with modern, secular knowledge and science. With mordant wit, she surveys an anti-rationalist landscape extending from pop culture to a pseudo-intellectual universe of \"junk thought.\" Disdain for logic and evidence defines a pervasive malaise fostered by the mass media, triumphalist religious fundamentalism, mediocre public education, a dearth of fair-minded public intellectuals on the right and the left, and, above all, a lazy and credulous public.",

        "description": "Mary McAuliffe's Dawn of the Belle Epoque took the reader from the multiple disasters of 1870-1871 through the extraordinary re-emergence of Paris as the cultural center of the Western world. Now, in Twilight of the Belle Epoque, McAuliffe portrays Paris in full flower at the turn of the twentieth century, where creative dynamos such as Picasso, Matisse, Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, Proust, Marie Curie, Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, and Isadora Duncan set their respective circles on fire with a barrage of revolutionary visions and discoveries. Such dramatic breakthroughs were not limited to the arts or sciences, as innovators and entrepreneurs such as Louis Renault, Andre Citroen, Paul Poiret, Francois Coty, and so many others--including those magnificent men and women in their flying machines--emphatically demonstrated. But all was not well in this world, remembered in hindsight as a golden age, and wrenching struggles between Church and state as well as between haves and have-nots shadowed these years, underscored by the ever-more-ominous drumbeat of the approaching Great War--a cataclysm that would test the mettle of the City of Light, even as it brutally brought the Belle Epoque to its close. Through rich illustrations and evocative narrative, McAuliffe brings this remarkable era from 1900 through World War I to vibrant life.",

Many observers of politics in post-Soviet Central Asia have assumed that corruption, nepotism, and patron-client relations would forestall democratization. Looking at the intersection of kinship ties with political patronage, Aksana Ismailbekova finds instead that this intertwining has in fact enabled democratization&#8212;both kinship and patronage develop apace with democracy, although patronage relations may stymie individual political opinion and action.",

Examining literary representations of social banditry to tell the story of Russian colonialism from the vantage point of its subjects, among numerous other themes, Gould argues that the literatures of anticolonial insurgency constitute a veritable resistance&#8212;or &#8220;transgressive sanctity&#8221;&#8212;to colonialism.",

In Kingdom of Olives and Ash , Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, two of today's most renowned novelists and essayists, have teamed up with the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence&#8212;an organization comprised of former Israeli soldiers who served in the occupied territories and saw firsthand the injustice there&#8212;and a host of illustrious writers to tell the stories of the people on the ground in the contested territories. Kingdom of Olives and Ash &#160;includes contributions from several of today&#8217;s most esteemed storytellers including: Colum McCann, Jacqueline Woodson, Colm Toibin, Geraldine Brooks, Dave Eggers, Hari Kunzru, Raja Shehadeh, Mario Vargas Llosa and Assaf Gavron, as well as from editors Chabon and Waldman. Through these incisive, perceptive, and poignant essays, readers&#160;will gain&#160;unique insight into the narratives behind the litany of grim destruction broadcasted nightly on the news,&#160;as well as&#160;deeper understanding of the conflict as&#160;experienced by &#160; the people who live in the occupied territories. Together, these stories stand witness to the human cost of the occupation.",

        "description": "This study is the first of its kind to examine the history and organization of trans-Saharan trade in western Africa using original source material. It documents the internal dynamics of a trade network system based on a case-study of the Wad Nun traders, who specialized in outfitting camel caravans in the nineteenth century. Through an examination of contracts, correspondence, fatwas, and interviews with retired caravaners, Lydon shows how traders used their literacy skills in Arabic and how they had recourse to experts of Islamic law to regulate their long-distance transactions. The book also examines the methods employed by women participating in caravan trade. By embracing a continental approach, this study bridges the divide between West African and North African studies. The work will be of interest to historians of African, Middle Eastern, and world history and to scholars of long-distance trade, Muslim societies, and Islamic law.",

This book asks what happens when narratives of war arise out of personal stories of those who were involved, stories that are still unfolding. Efrat Ben-Ze ev, an Israeli anthropologist, examines the memories of those who participated and were affected by the events of 1948, and how these events have been mythologized over time. This is a three-way conversation between Palestinian villagers, Jewish-Israeli veterans, and British policemen who were stationed in Palestine on the eve of the war. Each has his or her story to tell. Across the years, these witnesses relived their past in private within family circles and tightly knit groups, through gatherings and pilgrimages to sites of villages and battles, or through naming and storytelling. Rarely have their stories been revealed to an outsider. As Dr. Ben-Ze ev discovers, these small-scale truths, which were collected from people at the dusk of their lives and previously overshadowed by nationalized histories, shed new light on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as it was then and as it has become.",

The American death toll in Vietnam was approaching fifty thousand, and the ascendant counterculture was challenging nearly every aspect of American society.

As a dedicated human rights advocate and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Ebadi has almost single-handedly given both Iran and the world reason to hope for a better future.\" \"Now, in this memoir, Ebadi provides an eyewitness account of one woman's courageous stand at the crossroads of history. Best known as a lawyer who defends women and children in politically charged cases that most in her profession refuse to touch, Ebadi recounts her public career and reveals her private self: her faith, her experiences, and her desire to lead a traditional life even while serving as a rebellious voice in a land where such voices are muted or brutally silenced.\" \"Ebadi describes her girlhood in a modest Tehran household, her education, and her early professional success in the mid-1970s as Iran's most accomplished female jurist. She speaks eloquently about the ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and of her deep disillusionment with the direction Iran has since taken under the guidance of the hard-line clerics. She recounts the ignominy of her demotion to clerk in the courtroom over which she once presided, when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges. She speaks out against the oppressive patriarchy of Iran, where conservative rulers have stripped women of their basic rights and all citizens of their political freedom.\" In reading Shirin Ebadi's story, however, we come to see not a larger-than-life presence but a devoted daughter, wife, and mother, a down-to-earth woman who would never consider leaving on a lecture tour (or doing a stretch in prison) without first preparing enough meals for her husband and two daughters to last the duration of her absence. Ebadi is an everywoman, albeit one who has braved imprisonment, harassment, as",

Throughout the war, Atkins recruited, trained, and mentored the agents for the SOE's French Section, which sent more than four hundred young men and women into occupied France, at least one hundred of whom never returned and were reported MPD (missing presumed dead) after the war. Twelve of these were women and among Atkins' most cherished spies. When the war ended in 1945, she made it her personal mission to find out what happened to them and the other agents lost behind enemy lines, tracing rigorously their horrific final journeys. But as the woman who carried out this astonishing search appeared quintessentially English, Atkins was nothing of the sort. As we follow her through the devastation of postwar Germany, we learn Atkins herself covered her life in mystery so that even her closest family knew almost nothing of her past.",

Here, too, are the phobias, compulsions, odd beliefs, and weird habits that have placed them in the ranks of the bizarre, curious, and strange. You will discover, for instance, that Elvis Presley was convinced he could turn Graceland's sprinkler system on and off by the sheer power of concentration, that Salvador Dali ate vast quantities of Camembert cheese before bedtime to make his dreams more vivid, that Florence Nightingale carried a miniature pet owl in her pocket, while Kaiser Wilhelm II always carried with him photos of his deceased relatives in their funeral attire. You will learn, too, that the Victorian judge Lord Monboddo spent his entire life convinced that babies were born with tails (which midwives cut off), and that John Harvey Kellogg of cereal fame spent his wedding night writing an essay on the evils of sexual intercourse. Throughout the pages of this mammoth book you'll find impulses, whims, obsessions, and hangups as skewed as the schemes of Francisco Lopez, the Paraguay president who attempted to rout the Brazilian army with a battalion of small boys wearing false beards. You'll find cases galore that are screwier, too.",

Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, writing of this small group of Mormon women who've previously been seen as mere names and dates, has reconstructed these textured, complex lives to give us a portrait of who these women were and of their \"sex radicalism\"--the idea that a woman should choose when and with whom to bear children.",

        "description": "Misogyny is a hot topic, yet it's often misunderstood. What is misogyny, exactly? Who deserves to be called a misogynist? How does misogyny contrast with sexism, and why is it prone to persist--or increase--even when sexist gender roles are waning? This book is an exploration of misogyny in public life and politics, by the moral philosopher and writer Kate Manne. It argues that misogyny should not be understood primarily in terms of the hatred or hostility some men feel toward women generally. Rather, it's primarily about controlling, policing, punishing, and exiling the \"bad\" women who challenge male dominance. And it's compatible with rewarding \"the good ones,\" and singling out other women to serve as warnings to those who are out of order. It's also common for women to serve as scapegoats, be burned as witches, and treated as pariahs.",

As the son of the general manager, Stephen Lewis grew up in this legendary hotel, living with his parents and younger brother in a suite overlooking the Roxy Theater. His engaging memoir of his childhood captures the colorful, bustling atmosphere of the Taft, where his father, the best hotelman in New York, ruled a staff of Damon Runyonesque house dicks, chambermaids, bellmen, and waiters, who made sure that Stephen knew what to do with a swizzle stick by the time he was in the third grade.",

In the national hysteria that followed, eight others were arrested and tried; four of those were executed, four imprisoned. Therein lie all the classic elements of a great thriller. But the untold tale is even more fascinating.",

        "description": "Calling to mind a time when butchers and executioners knew more about anatomy than university-trained physicians, the phrase 'Medieval Medicine' conjures up horrors for us with our modern ideas on hygiene, instant pain relief and effective treatments. Although no one could allay the dread of plague, the medical profession provided cosmetic procedures, women's sanitary products, dietary advice and horoscopes predicting the sex of unborn babies or the best day to begin a journey. Surgeons performed life-saving procedures, sometimes using anaesthetics, with post-operative antibiotic and antiseptic treatments to reduce the chances of infection. They knew a few tricks to lessen the scarring, too. Yet alongside such expertise, some still believed that unicorns, dragons and elephants supplied vital medical ingredients and the caladrius bird could diagnose recovery or death. This is the weird, wonderful and occasionally beneficial world of medieval medicine. In her new book, popular historian Toni Mount guides the reader through this labyrinth of strange ideas and such unlikely remedies as leeches, meadowsweet, roasted cat and red bed curtains - some of which modern medicine is now coming to value - but without the nasty smells or any threat to personal wellbeing and safety. N.B. No animals, large, furry or mythological, were harmed during research for this book.",

In a daring act of humanity that trumped the deliberate savagery behind Riley&#8217;s presence in such a place, Zak single-handedly orchestrated a delicate rescue.&#160;What didn&#8217;t come out in the initial burst of publicity this story received is that Zak and Riley&#8217;s destinies were intertwined long before they improbably found each other. For much of Zak&#8217;s childhood, he was at the bottom of a veritable canyon himself&#8212;a canyon whose imprisoning depth and darkness was created by bullies who just wouldn&#8217;t quit and parents who weren&#8217;t capable of love. From the age of five, Zak was everyone&#8217;s favorite target.&#160;When Zak came upon Riley, the puppy&#8217;s condition bespoke his abusers&#8217; handiwork&#8212;three shotgun pellets embedded beneath his skin, teeth turned permanently black from malnutrition. The meeting was one of a man and a dog singularly suited to save each other. As a former US Marine sergeant, Zak was one of only a few people with the mettle and physical wherewithal to get Riley out. And in rescuing him, Zak was also attempting to save himself, conquering the currents of cruelty that swelled beneath his early life and always threatened to drown him.",

Attaining feminine perfection meant conforming to a mythical standard, one that would come wrapped in an adorable pink package, if those cunning marketers were to be believed. With wise humor and a savvy eye for curious, absurd, and at times wildly funny period artifacts, Lynn Peril gathers here the memorabilia of the era &#8212; from kitschy board games and lunch boxes to outdated advice books and health pamphlets &#8212; and reminds us how media messages have long endeavored to shape women's behavior and self-image, with varying degrees of success.",

Eller's answers demonstrate that the question is far more complicated, and its effects more pernicious, than it might at first appear.",

Smith, a man who runs his group like a football team, for whom no one member is greater than the Fall. Featuring a host of new interviews, this is a fascinating insight for all of The Fall's devoted fanbase, which famously included John Peel, and anyone who has ever been curious about the group, and interested in the post-punk cultural landscape of Britain.",

Irene (born 1896), Cynthia (born 1898), and Alexandra (born 1905) eventually revolted against their father's control. Irene had many affairs but never married. Cynthia married the up-and-coming Oswald Mosely, and Alexandra married the Prince of Wales&#8217; best friend, Fruity Metcalfe. Throughout the 1920s, the sisters were at the centre of a fast and glittering world. This biography provides insight into their lives, public and private, and gives a different view of German, Italian and British fascism. Based on unpublished letters and diaries, this book provides new revelations about Oswald Mosely, the Cliveden set, Lord Halifax, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.",

        "description": "The presidential election of 1920 was one of the most dramatic ever. For the only time in the nation's history, six once-and-future presidents hoped to end up in the White House: Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Theodore Roosevelt. It was an election that saw unprecedented levels of publicity -- the Republicans outspent the Democrats by 4 to 1 -- and it was the first to garner extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. It was also the first election in which women could vote. Meanwhile, the 1920 census showed that America had become an urban nation -- automobiles, mass production, chain stores, and easy credit were transforming the economy and America was limbering up for the most spectacular decade of its history, the roaring '20s. Award-winning historian David Pietrusza's riveting new work presents a dazzling panorama of presidential personalities, ambitions, plots, and counterplots -- a picture of modern America at the crossroads.",

A longtime critic of the Russian government, particularly with regard to its policies in Chechnya, she was special correspondent for the liberal Moscow newspaper Novaya gazeta. Beginning in '99, she authored numerous articles about the war in Chechnya & she was the only journalist to have constant access to the region. Her 2nd book on the Chechen War, A Small Corner of Hell, offers an insider's view of this ongoing conflict. In this book, she focuses attention on those caught in the crossfire. She recounts the everyday horrors of living in the midst of war, examines how the Chechen war has damaged Russian society & takes a hard look at the ways people on both sides profited from it. A Small Corner of Hell ensures that her words will not be erased.",

Although singles are singled out for unfair treatment by the workplace, the marketplace, and the federal tax structure, they are not simply victims of this singlism--single people really are living happily ever after.",

Internationally, their struggle is forgotten, as the West refuses to bring pressure to bear on its regional ally India. Kashmir: The Case for Freedom is an impassioned attempt to redress this imbalance and to fill the gap in our moral imagination. Covering Kashmir&#8217;s past and present and the occupation&#8217;s causes and consequences, the authors issue a clarion call for the withdrawal of Indian troops and for Kashmir&#8217;s right to self-determination.",

        "description": "On 13 December 2001, the Indian Parliament was attacked by a few heavily armed men. Eleven years later, we still do not know who was behind the attack, nor the identity of the attackers. Both the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court of India have noted that the police violated legal safeguards, fabricated evidence and extracted false confessions. Yet, on 9 February 2013, one man, Mohammad Afzal Guru, was hanged to satisfy the collective conscience of society. This updated reader brings together essays by lawyers, academics, journalists and writers who have looked closely at the available facts and who have raised serious questions about the investigations and the trial. This new version examines the implications of Mohammad Afzal Guru s hanging and what it says about the Indian government s relationship with Kashmir.",

        "description": "\"The hour of capitalism's greatest triumph,\" writes Hernando de Soto, \"is, in the eyes of four-fifths of humanity, its hour of crisis.\" In The Mystery of Capital, the world-famous Peruvian economist takes up the question that, more than any other, is central to one of the most crucial problems the world faces today: Why do some countries succeed at capitalism while others fail?In strong opposition to the popular view that success is determined by cultural differences, de Soto finds that it actually has everything to do with the legal structure of property and property rights. Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth. This persuasive book will revolutionize our understanding of capital and point the way to a major transformation of the world economy.",

Now, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis gives us the first full-length biography of Schulz: at once a creation story, a portrait of a hidden American genius, and a chronicle contrasting the private man with the central role he played in shaping the national imagination. The son of a barber, Schulz was born in Minnesota to modest, working class roots. In 1943, just three days after his mother&#8242;s tragic death from cancer, Schulz, a private in the army, shipped out for boot camp and the war in Europe. The sense of shock and separation never left him. And these early experiences would shape his entire life.",

The memories of many of those who knew her in wartime and thereafter, and 14 pages of photos, will underscore why Sergeant Reckless is honored still.",

The assembled group included the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley; his lover (and future wife) Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; Mary's stepsister Claire Claremont; and Byron's physician, John William Polidori. The famous result was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a work that has retained its hold on the popular imagination for almost two centuries. Less well-known was the curious Polidori's contribution: the first vampire novel. And the evening begat a curse, too: Within a few years of Frankenstein's publication, nearly all of those involved met untimely deaths. Drawing upon letters, rarely tapped archives, and their own magisterial rereading of Frankenstein itself, Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler have crafted a rip-roaring tale of obsession and creation.",

And after dinner, in her frilly party dress, she might catch a nap under the bar until closing. Her one constant was her glamorous, indomitable mother--nicknamed \"Patton in Pumps\" by one line cook--a wasp-waisted woman forever clad in stilettos and cocktail dresses who shouldered the burden of raising a family and running a kitchen after her husband left.",

In response, Mexico threw open its northern territories to American farmers in hopes that cotton could bring prosperity to the region. Thousands of Anglo-Americans poured into Texas, but their insistence that slavery accompany them sparked pitched battles across Mexico. An extraordinary alliance of Anglos and Mexicans in Texas came together to defend slavery against abolitionists in the Mexican government, beginning a series of fights that culminated in the Texas Revolution. In the aftermath, Anglo-Americans rebuilt the Texas borderlands into the most unlikely creation: the first fully committed slaveholders' republic in North America. ",

He believed that every book should be made for the reader's enjoyment. Newbery&#8212;for whom the prestigious Newbery Medal is named&#8212;became a celebrated author and publisher, changing the world of children's books forever.

Since that time, Brennan Manning has been dazzingly faithful in preaching and writing variations on that singular theme Yes, Abba is very fond of you! But today the crowds are gone and the lights are dim, the patches on his knees have faded. If he ever was a ragamuffin, truly it is now. In this his final book, Brennan roves back his past, honoring the lives of the people closest to him, family and friends who ve known the saint and the sinner, the boy and the man. Far from some chronological timeline, these memories are witness to the truth of life by one who has lived it \"All Is Grace.\"\"",

Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives they've transformed people whose mental limitations or brain damage were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.",

        "description": "In August of 1862, hundreds of Dakota warriors opened without warning a murderous rampage against settlers and soldiers in southern Minnesota. The vortex of the Dakota Uprising along the Minnesota River encompassed thousands of people in what was perhaps the greatest massacre of whites by Indians in American history. To read about the fast paced and unpredictable flood of killing and destruction is to discover heartrending emotion, irony, tragedy, cowardice, and heroism from unexpected quarters. Previous attempts to sort out individual experiences and place the events in a coherent chronological and geographical order have enjoyed little success. Award-winning author Gregory F. MichnoOCOs Dakota Dawn: The Decisive First Week of the Sioux Uprising, August 17OCo24, 1862 offers an essential clarity and vivid portrait that readers will find refreshing and invigorating.Dakota Dawn focuses in great detail on the first week of the killing spree, a great paroxysm of destruction when the Dakota succeeded, albeit fleetingly, in driving out the white man. During those seven days at least 400 white settlers were killed, the great majority innocent victims slaughtered in the most shocking manner. Nowhere else in the Western United States was there a record of such sustained attacks against a fort (Ridgely) or upon a town (New Ulm). After soldiers put down the uprising, hundreds of Dakotas were captured and put before military tribunals with little or no opportunity to present a fair defense; 38 were hanged on one massive gallows on December 26, 1862.MichnoOCOs research includes select secondary studies and 2,000 pages of primary sources including recollections, original records, diaries, newspaper accounts, and other archival records. One seldomused resource is the Indian Depredation Claim files. After the uprising, settlers filed nearly 3,000 claims for damages in which they itemized losses and set forth their experiences. These priceless documents paint firsthand slices of the life of a frontier people, their cabins, tools, clothes, crops, animals, and cherished possessions. Many of these claims have never been incorporated into a book; MichnoOCOs use of them allows him to more fully expound on various episodes and correct previous misconceptions. Richly illustrated with 42 contemporary and modern photos and illustrations and accompanied by 19 original maps, Dakota Dawn now stands as the definitive account of one of the most important and previously misunderstood events in American history.About the Author: Award-winning author Gregory F. Michno is a Michigan native and the author of three dozen articles and ten books dealing with World War II and the American West, including Lakota Noon; Battle at Sand Creek; The Encyclopedia of Indian Wars; The Deadliest Indian War in the West; and Circle the Wagons. Greg helped edit and appeared in the DVD history The Great Indian Wars: 1540-1890. He lives in Colorado, with his wife Susan.",

        "description": "In 1885, a former president of the United States published one of the most influential books ever written about the Civil War. An entire generation of Americans had eagerly awaited his memoirs and it has remained so popular that it has never gone out of print. Historiansathen and now have made extensive use of GrantOCOs recollections, which have shaped how we understand and evaluate not only the Union armyOCOs triumphs and failures, but many of the warOCOs key participants. TheaMemoirsaof Ulysses Simpson Grant may be a superbly written book, Frank P. Varney persuasively argues in General Grant and the Rewriting of History, but is so riddled with flaws as to be unreliable.Juxtaposing primary source documents (some of them published here for the first time) against GrantOCOs own pen and other sources, Professor Varney sheds new light on what really happened on some of the Civil WarOCOs most important battlefields. He does so by focusing much of his work on GrantOCOs treatment of Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, a capable army commander whose reputation Grant (and others working with him) conspired to destroy. GrantOCOs memoirs contain not only misstatements but outright inventions to manipulate the historical record. But GrantOCOs injustices go much deeper. He submitted decidedly biased reports, falsified official documents, and even perjured himself before an army court of inquiry. There is also strong evidence that his often-discussed drinking problem affected the outcome of at least one battle.General Grant was an outstanding soldier and, so we have long believed, a good man. HistoryOCOs wholesale acceptance of his version of events has distorted our assessment of Rosecrans and other officers, and even of the Civil War itself. Grant intentionally tried to control how future generations would remember the Civil War, and in large measure he succeeded. The first of two volumes on this subject, General Grant and the Rewriting of History aptly demonstrates, however, that blindly accepting historical truths without vigorous challenge is a perilous path to understanding real history.",

        "description": "Gender identity ideology is about more than twitter storms and using the right pronouns. In just ten years, laws, company policies, school and university curricula, sport, medical protocols, and the media have been reshaped to privilege self-declared gender identity over biological sex. People are being shamed and silenced for attempting to understand the consequences of redefining &#8216;man&#8217; and &#8216;woman&#8217;. While compassion for transgender lives is well-intentioned, it is stifling much-needed inquiry into the significance of our bodies.",

Ron Hubbard, claims to be the world&#8217;s fastest growing religion, with millions of members and huge financial holdings. Celebrity believers keep its profile high. Teams of volunteer ministers offer aid at disaster sites like Haiti and the World Trade Center. But Scientology is also a very closed faith, harassing journalists and others thru litigation & intimidation, even infiltrating high levels of the government to further its goals. Its attacks on psychiatry & its requirement that believers pay as much as tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars for salvation have drawn scrutiny and skepticism. Ex-members use the Internet to share stories of harassment and abuse.&#160;Reitman offers the first full journalistic history of the Church of Scientology, in an evenhanded account that establishes the truth about the controversial religion. She traces Scientology&#8217;s development from the birth of Dianetics to today, following its metamorphosis from a pseudoscientific self-help group to a global spiritual corporation with profound control over its followers and ex-followers.&#160;Based on five years of research, unprecedented access to Church officials, confidential documents and extensive interviews with current and former members, this is a defining book about a little-known world.",

From the Siberian migrations across the Bering Strait fifteen thousand years ago and the European expeditions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the nineteenth-century exploration and occupation of the Hawaiian Islands, Taylor traces the complex ecological, ethnic, and economic history and colonization of the New World from coast to coast, from the Canadian north to the Pacific rim.Examining the repeatedly overlooked influence of the continent's natives upon the colonists and the resulting mutual dependence of the two, Taylor presents a unique and revelatory view of colonial North America. European colonists, African slaves, and native people met one another and interacted at a pace and intensity unparalleled in global history. The effects of this staggering confluence of cultural, ecological, military, diplomatic, and economic interests are still being felt in America today. This fascinating and involving history of the origins of the United States will provoke and appeal to all readers of American history.",

        "description": "LONG-LISTED FOR THE CARNEGIE MEDAL Reminiscent of the work of Nobel Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich, an astonishing collection of intimate wartime testimonies and poetic fragments from a cross-section of Syrians whose lives have been transformed by revolution, war, and flight. Against the backdrop of the wave of demonstrations known as the Arab Spring, in 2011 hundreds of thousands of Syrians took to the streets demanding freedom, democracy and human rights. The government&#8217;s ferocious response, and the refusal of the demonstrators to back down, sparked a brutal civil war that over the past five years has escalated into the worst humanitarian catastrophe of our times. Yet despite all the reporting, the video, and the wrenching photography, the stories of ordinary Syrians remain unheard, while the stories told about them have been distorted by broad brush dread and political expediency. This fierce and poignant collection changes that. Based on interviews with hundreds of displaced Syrians conducted over four years across the Middle East and Europe, We Crossed a Bridge and It Trembled is a breathtaking mosaic of first-hand testimonials from the frontlines. Some of the testimonies are several pages long, eloquent narratives that could stand alone as short stories; others are only a few sentences, poetic and aphoristic. Together, they cohere into an unforgettable chronicle that is not only a testament to the power of storytelling but to the strength of those who face darkness with hope, courage, and moral conviction.",

McManus examines, with great intensity and thoroughness, the American experience in the weeks leading up to D-Day and on the great day itself. From the build up in England to the night drops of airborne forces behind German lines and the landings on the beaches at dawn, from the famed figures of Eisenhower, Bradley, and Lightin' Joe Collins to the courageous, but little-known privates who fought so bravely, and under terrifying conditions, this is the story of the American experience at D-Day. What were the battles really like for the Americans at Utah and Omaha? What drove them to fight despite all adversity? How and why did they triumph? Thanks to extensive archival research, and the use of hundreds of first hand accounts, McManus answers these questions and many more.",

He draws on an array of recently discovered evidence and shows how new findings have radically transformed understandings of belief and ritual in Britain before the arrival of organized religion.",

Moving seamlessly between tactical details and analysis of strategic significance, Peter Cozzens presents a balanced, comprehensive account of a campaign that has long been romanticized but little understood. He offers new interpretations of the campaign and the reasons for Stonewall Jackson's success, demonstrates instances in which the mythology that has come to shroud the campaign has masked errors on Jackson's part, and provides the first detailed appraisal of Union leadership in the Valley Campaign, with some surprising conclusions.",

        "description": "In the tradition of Simon Winchester and Dava Sobel, The Riddle of the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code tells one of the most intriguing stories in the history of language, masterfully blending history, linguistics, and cryptology with an elegantly wrought narrative. When famed archaeologist Arthur Evans unearthed the ruins of a sophisticated Bronze Age civilization that flowered on Crete 1,000 years before Greece's Classical Age, he discovered a cache of ancient tablets, Europe's earliest written records. For half a century, the meaning of the inscriptions, and even the language in which they were written, would remain a mystery. Award-winning New York Times journalist Margalit Fox's riveting real-life intellectual detective story travels from the Bronze Age Aegean--the era of Odysseus, Agamemnon, and Helen--to the turn of the 20th century and the work of charismatic English archeologist Arthur Evans, to the colorful personal stories of the decipherers. These include Michael Ventris, the brilliant amateur who deciphered the script but met with a sudden, mysterious death that may have been a direct consequence of the decipherment; and Alice Kober, the unsung heroine of the story whose painstaking work allowed Ventris to crack the code.",

Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. Using sensory data that flow in through the senses, the brain naturally begins to look for and find patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning, forming beliefs. Once beliefs are formed the brain begins to look for and find confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, accelerating the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive-feedback loop.",

        "description": "For eighteen years, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith have been part of a team revolutionizing the study of politics by turning conventional wisdom on its head. They start from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They don&#8217;t care about the &#8220;national interest&#8221;&#8212;or even their subjects&#8212;unless they have to. This clever and accessible book shows that the difference between tyrants and democrats is just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty. But it just may be the truth, which is a good starting point for anyone seeking to improve human governance.",

The right of neutrality; to live in peace from the imperial wars waged between France and England; had been one of the founding values of Acadia; its settlers traded and intermarried freely with native M&#236;kmaq Indians and English Protestants alike. But the Acadians' refusal to swear unconditional allegiance to the British Crown in the mid-eighteenth century gave New Englanders, who had long coveted Nova Scotia's fertile farmland, pretense enough to launch a campaign of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.",

They were not alone: Sherman, Davis, Jackson nearly all of the Civil War's greatest soldiers had been forged in the heat of Vera Cruz and Monterrey. The Mexican War has faded from our national memory, but it was a struggle of enormous significance: the first U.S. war waged on foreign soil; and it nearly doubled our nation. ",

        "description": "Weaving decades of field observations with exciting new discoveries about the brain, Carl Safina's landmark book offers an intimate view of animal behavior to challenge the fixed boundary between humans and nonhuman animals. In Beyond Words, listeners travel to Amboseli National Park in the threatened landscape of Kenya and witness struggling elephant families work out how to survive poaching and drought, then to Yellowstone National Park to observe wolves sort out the aftermath of one pack's personal tragedy, and finally plunge into the astonishingly peaceful society of killer whales living in the crystalline waters of the Pacific Northwest. Beyond Words brings forth powerful and illuminating insight into the unique personalities of animals through extraordinary stories of animal joy, grief, jealousy, anger, and love. The similarity between human and nonhuman consciousness, self-awareness, and empathy calls us to reevaluate how we interact with animals. Wise, passionate, and eye-opening at every turn, Beyond Words is ultimately a graceful examination of humanity's place in the world.",

        "description": "Americans have long had a fixation with the occult. Now, well-known writer and expert on the occult Mitch Horowitz presents a meticulously researched, compulsively readable history of the mystical and spiritual experience in our country. Focusing on the tremendous impact that nineteenth-century movements such as Freemasonry, Spiritualism, and transcendentalism have had on America, Horowitz explains the origins of the Ouija board, the political influence of Spiritualism on the Senate, and the source of the mysterious slogan on the back of the dollar bill. The colorful cast of characters extends from those on the margins of documented history to famous heroes like Abraham Lincoln. Occult America will appeal to history buffs, spirituality enthusiasts, and everyone who savors fascinating narrative nonfiction.",

        "description": "In 1919 Sian Busby's great-grandmother gave birth to triplets. One of the babies died at birth, and eleven days later she drowned the surviving twins in a bath of cold water. She was sentenced to an indefinite term in a prison for the criminally insane. For generations to come, the author's family dealt with the murders and the accompanying shame, guilt, and anxiety by suppressing the disturbing memory. It wasn't until Busby began to experience severe bouts of postpartum depression herself that she felt compelled to learn more about this shadowy story, ultimately immersing herself in the puzzling and horrific tragedy that had quietly shaped her family's collective history. In Cruel Mother, Busby digs out her own postpartum depression, by re-creating not only the broader reality of post-WWI working class England, but the more intimate setting in which her great-grandmother tried to raise a family. In the process, Busby brings ghosts to very real and familiar life, making these unexpected and inexplicable deaths that much more tragic. Ultimately, Busby and the reader are left not only with new understanding, but heartfelt empathy for all involved.",

Three battalions and fewer than a thousand men launched a violent thrust of tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles into the heart of a city of 5 million people and in three days of bloody combat ended the Iraqi war. Thunder Run is the story of the surprise assault on Baghdad&#8212;one of the most decisive battles in American combat history&#8212;by the Spartan Brigade, the Second Brigade of the Third Infantry Division (Mechanized). More than just a rendering of a single battle, Thunder Run candidly recounts how soldiers respond under fire and stress and how human frailties are magnified in a war zone. The product of over a hundred interviews with commanders and men from the Second Brigade, Thunder Run is a riveting firsthand account of how a single armored brigade was able to capture an Arab capital defended by one of the world's largest armies.",

Kirkland served American expansion as a missionary and agent, promoting Indian conversion and dispossession. Brant pursued an alternative future for the continent by defending an Indian borderland nestled between the British in Canada and the Americans, rather than divided by them.",

She chronicles the decline of the white dress for both boys and girls, the introduction of rompers in the early 20th century, the gendering of pink and blue, the resurgence of unisex fashions, and the origins of today's highly gender-specific baby and toddler clothing.",

Tyson and Lang call it a \"curiously complicit\" alliance. \"The universe is both the ultimate frontier and the highest of high grounds,\" they write. \"Shared by both space scientists and space warriors, it&#8217;s a laboratory for one and a battlefield for the other. The explorer wants to understand it; the soldier wants to dominate it. But without the right technology&#8212;which is more or less the same technology for both parties&#8212;nobody can get to it, operate in it, scrutinize it, dominate it, or use it to their advantage and someone else&#8217;s disadvantage.\"",

        "description": "American Ginseng has a strange and perilous history. It has one of the longest germination periods of any known species, and only two environments in the world have offered the ideal growing conditions for wild ginseng. The first was the forests of northern China, which disappeared over a millennium ago, and the sole remaining habitat is the Appalachian Mountain region of eastern North America, an area now threatened by logging and mining. Chinese legend says that ginseng is the child of lightning. The two elemental forces of water and fire fight in an eternal struggle, pouring down rain and snow and blasting the earth with lightning. If that lightning happens to strike a spring of water, the water disappears and in its place grows a ginseng plant -- the fusion of yin and yang, water and fire, darkness and light, and the life force that moves the universe. American ginseng has become perhaps the most treasured of all herbal medicines, promising good health and longevity to those who consume it. Fortunes have been made and lost on the plant, which was America's first export to China -- before our nation even existed. The strange, twisted, man-shaped root today commands as much as two thousand dollars a pound in the hot, noisy ginseng markets of Hong Kong, and a wealthy collector might pay as much as $10,000 for a single, perfect specimen. Ginseng Dreams: The Secret World of America's Most Valuable Plant unfolds ginseng's past and its future through the stories of seven people whose lives have become inextricably bound to it: a huckster, a field researcher, a farmer, a ginseng \"missionary,\" a criminal investigator, a broker, and a cancer researcher. Each of these individuals brings a different perspective to the elusive root -- and each is consumed by a different dream. Kristin Johannsen threads her way though remote woodlands in the Appalachians to observe the fragile plants slowly putting out leaves as part of a three-year growing cycle, during which time the ginseng is vulnerable to both poachers and growing suburban sprawl. She contrasts this with the huge commercial growing fields of Marathon County, Wisconsin, where among potato fields and paper mills, ninety percent of the country's ginseng is produced. Johannsen explores the brisk black market trade in the panacean root and the efforts to save the wild species and its native habitat, and she ends her story in the laboratory, where researchers are investigating ginseng's anti-cancer properties. An absorbing journey into the many worlds of this mysterious and potent plant, Ginseng Dreams tells the extraordinary story of America's little-known natural treasure and the spell it casts on those who seek it.",

Yet, despite Augustus&#8217;s accomplishments, very few biographers have concentrated on the man himself, instead choosing to chronicle the age in which he lived.

        "description": "Have you ever wondered how one day the media can assert that alcohol is bad for us and the next unashamedly run a story touting the benefits of daily alcohol consumption? Or how a drug that is pulled off the market for causing heart attacks ever got approved in the first place? How can average readers, who aren't medical doctors or Ph.D.s in biochemistry, tell what they should be paying attention to and what's, well, just more bullshit?",

Browning draws the experiences of the Jewish prisoners, the Nazi authorities, and the neighboring Poles together into a chilling history of a little-known dimension of the Holocaust. Combining harrowing detail and insightful analysis on the Starachowice camps and their role in the Holocaust, Browning&#8217;s history is indispensable scholarship and an unforgettable story of survival.",

        "description": "The history of footbinding is full of contradictions and unexpected turns. The practice originated in the dance culture of China's medieval court and spread to gentry families, brothels, maid's quarters, and peasant households. Conventional views of footbinding as patriarchal oppression often neglect its complex history and the incentives of the women involved. This revisionist history, elegantly written and meticulously researched, presents a fascinating new picture of the practice from its beginnings in the tenth century to its demise in the twentieth century. Neither condemning nor defending foot-binding, Dorothy Ko debunks many myths and misconceptions about its origins, development, and eventual end, exploring in the process the entanglements of male power and female desires during the practice's thousand-year history.",

        "description": "John Perkins started and stopped writing Confessions of an Economic Hit Man four times over 20 years. He says he was threatened and bribed in an effort to kill the project, but after 9/11 he finally decided to go through with this expose of his former professional life. Perkins, a former chief economist at Boston strategic-consulting firm Chas. T. Main, says he was an \"economic hit man\" for 10 years, helping U.S. intelligence agencies and multinationals cajole and blackmail foreign leaders into serving U.S. foreign policy and awarding lucrative contracts to American business. \"Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars,\" Perkins writes. Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an extraordinary and gripping tale of intrigue and dark machinations. Think John Le Carr&#233;, except it's a true story.",

A whole raft of remarkable conceptsnow rides atop the scientific firmament, including parallel universes, warped geometry, and threedimensional sink-holes. We understand far more about the world than we did just a few short years ago -- and yet we are more uncertain about the true nature of the universe than ever before. Have wereached a point of scientific discovery so advanced that the laws of physics as we know them are simply not sufficient? Will we all soon have to acceptexplanations that previously remained in the realm of science fiction?",

Operating in Chicago&#8217;s notorious Levee district at the dawn of the last century, the Club&#8217;s proprietors, two aristocratic sisters named Minna and Ada Everleigh, welcomed moguls and actors, senators and athletes, foreign dignitaries and literary icons, into their stately double mansion, where thirty stunning Everleigh &#8220;butterflies&#8221; awaited their arrival. Courtesans named Doll, Suzy Poon Tang, and Brick Top devoured raw meat to the delight of Prince Henry of Prussia and recited poetry for Theodore Dreiser. Whereas lesser madams pocketed most of a harlot&#8217;s earnings and kept a &#8220;whipper&#8221; on staff to mete out discipline, the Everleighs made sure their girls dined on gourmet food, were examined by an honest physician, and even tutored in the literature of Balzac.",

How was the new Russian regime to deal with the complexity of its population? This book examines the role of nation and nationality in the Soviet Union and analyzes the establishment of national republics in Soviet Central Asia. It argues that the originally nationally minded Soviet communists with their anti-nationalist attitudes came to view nation and national identity as valuable and constructive tools in state constructions.",

While journalists trumpeted the importance of following science to &#8220;flatten the curve,&#8221; they praised Governors Andrew Cuomo and Phil Murphy, who sanctioned ill-equipped nursing homes to take COVID-positive patients, leading to an enormous death spike for New York and New Jersey. Plus, the old guard medical establishment captured by Dr. Fauci proved to be far too rigid&#160;during a health care emergency.&#160; While some state legislators are still concealing accurate records of nursing home deaths, many others have made anti-science decisions regarding re-opening plans; all of which fuel distrust and civil unrest. Democrat mayors like Bill de Blasio openly admitted that their decisions to keep schools closed were fueled by a &#8220;social contract&#8221; with teachers (that is: teachers&#8217; unions), despite hard science saying this would be harmful.",

In this utterly fascinating book, Cambridge historian Mary Laven uncovers the long-hidden stories of the \"virgins of Venice\" and the secret, and often surprising, lives they led. ",

        "description": "Teenage boys are wild about girls.When their hormones kick in at puberty, they can think of nothing else, and thats the way it has always been-- right? Wrong. Before World War II, only sissies liked girls. Masculine, red-blooded, all-American boys were supposed to ignore girls until they were 18 or 19. Instead, parents, teachers, psychiatrists, and especially the mass media encouraged them to form passionate, intense, romantic bonds with each other. This book explores romantic relationships between teenage boys as they were portrayed before, during, and immediately after World War II. The author takes the reader through a rich landscape of media -- sci fi pulps, comics, adventure stories, tales of teen sleuths, boys' serial novels, wartime bestsellers, and movies populated by many types of male adolescents: Boys Next Door, Adventure Boys, Jungle Boys, and Lost Boys. In Hollywood movies, Boys Next Door like Jackie Cooper, Ronald Sinclair, and Jimmy Lydon were constantly falling in love, but not with girls. In serial novels, Jungle Boys like Bomba, Sorak, and Og Son of Fire swung through the trees to rescue teenage boys, not teenage girls. In comic strips and on the radio, Adventure Boys like Don Study, Jack Armstrong, and Tim Tyler formed lasting romantic partnerships with other boys or men. Lost Boys like Frankie Darro, Leo Gorcey, and Billy Halop starred in dozens of movies about pairs of poor urban teenagers sticking together, with never a girl in sight.",

Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.",

Historian Ellis guides readers thru the decisive issues of the nation's founding, and illuminates the emerging philosophies, shifting alliances, and personal and political foibles of now iconic leaders. He explains how the idea of a strong federal government, championed by Washington, was eventually embraced by the American people, the majority of whom had to be won over. He details the emergence of the two-party system--then a political novelty--which today stands as the founders' most enduring legacy. But Ellis is equally incisive about their failures, making clear how their inability to abolish slavery and to reach a just settlement with the Native Americans has played an equally important role in shaping our national character. Ellis strips the mythic veneer of the revolutionary generation to reveal men possessed of both brilliance and blindness.",

Kaku skillfully guides us through the latest innovations in string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, which posits that our universe may be just one in an endless multiverse, a singular bubble floating in a sea of infinite bubble universes. If M-theory is proven correct, we may perhaps finally find answer to the question, &#8220;What happened before the big bang?&#8221; This is an exciting and unforgettable introduction into the new cutting-edge theories of physics and cosmology from one of the pre-eminent voices in the field.",

Arguing that the utopian Bolshevik project of remaking the world featured a sustained assault on Islam that destroyed patterns of Islamic learning and thoroughly de-Islamized public life, Khalid demonstrates that Islam became synonymous with tradition and was subordinated to powerful ethnonational identities that crystallized during the Soviet period. He shows how this legacy endures today and how, for the vast majority of the population, a return to Islam means the recovery of traditions destroyed under Communism.",

This broad understanding of political corruption--rooted in ideals of civic virtue--was a driving force at the Constitutional Convention.",

        "description": "This book is a provocative contribution to contemporary ethics and moral psychology, challenging fundamental assumptions about character dating to Aristotle. John Doris draws on an array of social scientific research, especially experimental social psychology, to argue that people often grossly overestimate the behavioral impact of character and grossly underestimate the behaviorial impact of situations. Circumstance, Doris concludes, often has extraordinary influence on what people do, whatever sort of character they may appear to have. He then considers the implications of this observation for a range of issues in ethics, arguing that with more realistic picture effect, cognition, and motivation, moral psychology can support more compelling ethical theories and more humane ethical practices.",

In what would become an iconic sports image, Switzer escaped and finished the race. This was a watershed moment for the sport, as well as a significant event in women's history.Including updates from the 2008 Summer Olympics, the paperback edition of Marathon Woman details the life of an incredible, pioneering athlete, and the lasting effect she's had on women's sports. Switzer's energy and drive permeate the pages of this warm, witty memoir as she describes everything from the childhood events that inspired her to succeed to her big win in the 1974 New York City Marathon, and beyond.",

        "description": "As a boy Matthew Waterhouse loved Doctor Who. He watched all the episodes, and read all the novels and comic strips...and so Blue Box Boy starts as a heart-warming story, of a boy growing up with Doctor Who as his trusted friend, then takes a sudden twist when he is thrust into an alien and adult world, cast as Doctor Who's youngest ever traveling companion for two of the show's most inventive seasons. Matthew's sense of wonder at his dream job and his love for the show are palpable, as is his shock at genuine hostilities between cast and crew members and the tensions on set, which are counterpointed by poignant reminders that he is just a boy - and still a fan - who finds himself in the absurd, comic world of minor celebrity. Written with honesty, warmth, wit and a dose of self-deprecation, this audiobook is essential listening for any Doctor Who fan. Finally, we get to hear Matthew's side of a story which has been told, embellished and imagined by fans and fellow actors for years. This affectionate and darkly humorous memoir is a record of what it was like to make Doctor Who, and to work for the BBC, in the early 80s...",

However over the past decade there has been a rising movement to accurately describe Native cultures and histories. In particular, people have begun to explore the experience of urban Indians&#8212;individuals who live in two worlds struggling to preserve traditional Native values within the context of an ever-changing modern society. In Genocide of the Mind, the experience and determination of these people is recorded in a revealing and compelling collection of essays that brings the Native American experience into the twenty-first century. Contributors include: Paula Gunn Allen, Simon Ortiz, Sherman Alexie, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Maurice Kenny, as well as emerging writers from different Indian nations.",

        "description": "WHEN A YOUNG WRITER named Lorne Michaels talked NBC executives into taking a chance on a new weekend late-night comedy series, nobody really knew what to expect-not even Michaels. But Saturday Night Live, launched in 1975 and still thriving today, would change the face of television. It introduced brash new stars with names like Belushi, Radner, Chase, and Murray; trashed taboos that had inhibited TV for decades; and had such an impact on American life, laughter, and politics that even presidents of the United States had to take notice. Now, Pulitzer Prize-winner Tom Shales and bestselling author James Andrew Miller bring together stars, writers, guest hosts, contributors, and craftsmen for the first-ever oral history of Saturday Night Live, from 1974, when it was just an idea, through 2002, when it has long since become an institution. In their own words, dozens of personalities recall the backstage stories, behind-the-scenes gossip, feuds, foibles, drugs, sex, struggles, and calamities, including personal details never before revealed. Shales and Miller have interviewed a galaxy of stars, including Mike Myers, Chris Rock, Bill Murray, Tom Hanks, Adam Sandler, Chevy Chase, Will Ferrell, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Martin, Jon Lovitz, Jane Curtin, Billy Crystal, Martin Short, Dana Carvey, Tina Fey, Jimmy Fallon, Chris Kattan, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Garrett Morris, Molly Shannon, Damon Wayans, Chris Elliott, Julia Sweeney, Norm Macdonald, and Paul Simon-plus writers like Al Franken, Conan O'Brien, Larry David, Rosie Shuster, Jack Handey, Robert Smigel, Don Novello, and others who got their big breaks as part of the SNL team. The Coneheads, the Blues Brothers, Buck-wheat, Wayne and Garth, Hans and Franz, the Cheerleaders, Todd DiLaMuca and Lisa Loopner, \"Cheeseburger cheeseburger,\" Mango, the Church Lady, Ed Grimley-they're all here. And for every fabulous character on-screen there was an outrageous maverick, misfit, or rebel behind the scenes. Live from New York does what no other book about the show has ever done: It lets the people who were there tell the story in their own words, blunt and loving and uncensored.",

Firstly, he was one of the two fathers of the movement, giving the new group its now famous name. As general secretary of the group he maintained all the correspondence and documentation.

        "description": "What would you give up to achieve your dream? When J. P. Morgan hired Belle da Costa Greene in 1905 to organize his rare book and manuscript collection, she had only her personality and a few years of experience to recommend her. Ten years later, she had shaped the famous Pierpont Morgan Library collection and was a proto-celebrity in New York and the art world, renowned for her self-made expertise, her acerbic wit, and her flirtatious relationships. Born to a family of free people of color, Greene changed her name and invented a Portuguese grandmother to enter white society. In her new world, she dined both at the tables of the highest society and with bohemian artists and activists. She also engaged in a decades-long affair with art critic Bernard Berenson. Greene is pure fascination&#8212;the buyer of illuminated manuscripts who attracted others to her like moths to a flame.",

The twentieth century was not born in the trenches of the Somme or Passchendaele&#8212;but rather in the fifteen vertiginous years preceding World War I.In this short span of time, a new world order was emerging in ultimately tragic contradiction to the old. These were the years in which the political and personal repercussions of the Industrial Revolution were felt worldwide: Cities grew like never before as people fled the countryside and their traditional identities; science created new possibilities as well as nightmares; education changed the outlook of millions of people; mass-produced items transformed daily life; industrial laborers demanded a share of political power; and women sought to change their place in society&#8212;as well as the very fabric of sexual relations.",

        "description": "'I return to Paris in five days. Stop washing.' So wrote Napoleon to Josephine in an age when body odour was considered an aphrodisiac. In stark contrast, the Romans used to bath for hours each day. Ashenburg's investigation of history's ambivalence towards personal hygiene takes her through plague-ridden streets, hospitals and battlefields. From the bizarre prescriptions of doctors to the eccentricities of famous bathers, she presents us with all the twists and turns that have led us to our own, arbitrary notion of 'clean'.",

        "description": "Virtually all philosophers agree that for a belief to be epistemically justified, it must satisfy certain conditions. Perhaps it must be supported by evidence. Or perhaps it must be reliably formed. Or perhaps there are some other \"good-making\" features it must have. But does a belief's justification also require some sort of awareness of its good-making features? The answer to this question has been hotly contested in contemporary epistemology, creating a deep divide among its practitioners. Internalists, who tend to focus on scientific or theoretical beliefs as the ideal, insist that such awareness is required for justification. Externalists, who think children's ordinary beliefs in obvious facts are paradigm cases of justified belief, say it isn't required. Michael Bergmann's book offers a decisive refutation of internalism and a sustained defense of externalism.",

A complex social process 'naturalises' her deprivation and the family itself is a site of gender-based discrimination. Thirteen case studies poignantly reveal the way discrimination occurs. The authors have used the data for West Bengal compiled by the School of Women's Studies, Jadavpur University, as part of the national project on the girl child, covering girls aged 7-18 years. It offers detailed analysis of the girl child's mother and her perceptions of her children; of her daughters in particular.",

        "description": "The author of the national bestseller Love is a Mix Tape returns, with a different-but equally personal and equally universal- spin on music as memory. \"No rock critic-living or dead, American or otherwise-has ever written about pop music with the evocative, hyperpoetic perfectitude of Rob Sheffield.\" So said Chuck Klosterman about Love is a Mix Tape, Sheffield's paean to a lost love via its soundtrack. Now, in Talking to Girls About Duran Duran, Sheffield shares the soundtrack to his eighties adolescence. When he turned 13 in 1980, Rob Sheffield had a lot to learn about women, love, music and himself, and in Talking to Girls About Duran Duran we get a glimpse into his transformation from pasty, geeky \"hermit boy\" into a young man with his first girlfriend, his first apartment, and a sense of the world. These were the years of MTV and John Hughes movies; the era of big dreams and bigger shoulder pads; and, like any all-American boy, this one was searching for true love and maybe a cooler haircut. It's all here: Inept flirtations. Dumb crushes. Deplorable fashion choices. Members Only jackets. Girls, every last one of whom seems to be madly in love with the bassist of Duran Duran. Sheffield's coming-of-age story is one that we all know, with a playlist that any child of the eighties or anyone who just loves music will sing along with. These songs-and Sheffield's writing-will remind readers of that first kiss, that first car, and the moments that shaped their lives.",

Unlike their geisha counterparts, courtesans didn't lived in brothels or bend their wills to suit their suitors. They were the muses who enflamed the hearts of our most celebrated artists--Raphael, Manet, Dumas, and Proust, to name just a few--as well as becoming artists in their own right. Offering the first comprehensive tour of their worlds, Susan Griffins celebrates these first feminists and hails their virtues: Timing, Beauty, Cheek, Brilliance, Gaiety, Grace, and Charm. ",

        "description": "William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli were the fiercest political rivals of the nineteenth century. Their intense mutual hatred was both ideologically driven and deeply personal. Their vitriolic duels, carried out over decades, lend profound insight into the social and political currents that dominated Victorian England. To Disraeli&#8212;a legendary dandy descended from Sephardic Jews&#8212;his antagonist was an \"unprincipled maniac\" characterized by an \"extraordinary mixture of envy, vindictiveness, hypocrisy, and superstition.\" For the conservative aristocrat Gladstone, his rival was \"the Grand Corrupter,\" whose destruction he plotted \"day and night, week by week, month by month.\" In the tradition of Roy Jenkins and A. N. Wilson, Richard Aldous has written an outstanding political biography, giving us the first dual portrait of this intense and momentous rivalry. Aldous's vivid narrative style&#8212;by turns powerful, witty, and stirring&#8212;brings new life to the Gladstone and Disraeli story and confirms a perennial truth: in politics, everything is personal.",

Yet, within half a century, &#8220;heterosexual&#8221; had become a byword for &#8220;normal,&#8221; enshrined in law, medicine, psychiatry, and the media as a new gold standard for human experience.

They rode roller coasters and water slides, tried to locate some Hollywood celebrities, met some aliens at a UFO center in Sedona, sat on a ledge on top of the country's tallest building in Chicago, spray painted Cadillac Ranch, dodged mule poop at the Grand Canyon, and bought a pressed coin at Old Faithful. They also visited Mount Rushmore, Vegas, Dallas, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and many points in between.

        "description": "This book could save your life! If you've ever wondered what it's like working at a hospital Level 1 trauma center this book offers unfiltered true stories which occurred during a surgeon's first year of training. The book offers insight into 21st century modern healthcare and the state of society. You will laugh, cry, and question your beliefs about the healthcare system and patients. Read this before you go to the doctor next and share this information with your family. Throughout the United States stories like these are unfolding each day as you witness the stress of physician training and the ups and downs of the physician's and patient's lives. Dr. Brandon Green is a pseudonym, or pen name, for author who wishes to remain anonymous. He is an Attending Surgeon at an inner-city Level 1 Trauma Center. The author's goals for writing this book include the following: 1.Create awareness and discussion about today&#8217;s healthcare and society. 2.Raise money with 30% of profits from the sale of this book being donated to healthcare non-profit organizations such as the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and any current global medical pandemic funds. 3.Therapy for the author to recount the intern year, which was more stressful and educational than ever imagined. Unexpected emotions occurred and life lessons were taught beyond the surgical training. The short stories are real occurrences that happened to the author and his other two co-interns in one residency year. The author broke ties with the publisher who wanted to adjust the stories to meet societal norms, and now the work is being self published with profits as above going to charity instead of a large publishing company. The names and locations have been changed to provide privacy protection and follow HIPPA guidelines. The author hopes to continue dialogue and discussion on stories from behind the scenes at hospitals, clinics, and in the operating rooms. It's beneficial to communicate with colleagues and other healthcare professionals and staff running into similar circumstances on a day to day basis. Please visit DIARYOFAHO.COM and email your stories to be published on the website and social media.This is a work of sociology, psychology, medicine, surgery, dealing with the public, putting others ins front of yourself, and self-reflective learning. Any story will be accepted and uploaded into the blog and social media. Stories will be screened for HIPPA compliance prior to publishing online. Thank you for taking the time to read and understand what&#8217;s happening in modern healthcare training.",

Almost all accounts of D Day are told from the Allied perspective. But what was it like to be a German soldier in the bunkers of the Normandy coast, facing the onslaught of the mightiest invasion in history? What motivated the German defenders, what were their thought processes - and how did they fight from one strong point to another, among the dunes and fields, on that first cataclysmic day? This book sheds fascinating light on these questions, bringing together statements made by German survivors after the war, when time had allowed them to reflect on their state of mind, their actions and their choices of June 6th. We see a perspective of D Day which deserves to be added to the historical record, in which ordinary German troops struggled to make sense of what was facing them, and emerged stunned at the weaponry and sheer determination of the Allied troops. Above all, we now have the unheard human voices of the individual German soldiers - the men who are so often portrayed as a faceless mass.",

        "description": "The messages in this book are a combination of my education, experiences as well as missives that come to me from a source that I cannot define. You may call it deep intuition, a gift from beyond or the source. I write the words that come through my hands, when I read them back, I feel inspired and enlightened. I know that anyone reading the narration needs the energy being relayed and will benefit from it. Many of these statements though this book have questions for you to answer, there is work to be done. Messages alone cannot resolve all your challenges. Being honest with yourself and feeling the emotions that arise when you explore these ideas will open your best course for personal tranquility. Each chapter will start with a story that is a combination of experiences people have had related to the chapter topic. The way that you access this book is completely up to you but my idea behind its use is that you open the book when you feel you need some inspiration or guidance. Open to any page, that page or paragraph you see will be your message for the day or moment. The words will be aligned with what you are seeking. Of course, feel free to read through the book or look to a specific chapter for guidance. The messages you find will be energetically aligned to your needs. Many of the lessons may seem similar but worded in a unique way. This is important because messages will resonate in various ways at different times for the reader. There are very simple ways to improve your life, outlook, and experiences. It may take time to understand the messages and work with them but when you learn how to view your encounters from a place of growth, a whole new world will open to you.",

        "description": "If your main focus is to find love, then find love. If you are looking to have casual sex, say so. People are often surprised at what they find when they are honest about their intentions. The Essential Guide on How to be a Hoe is a modern look on one of the oldest states in the world. The hoe. No, I don't mean the gardening tool. I mean what it takes to become sexually positive and take ownership of our bodies in a world that is constantly violating us with new advice, old ideas, and outdated judgements. People say we can be free but how? This is the problem that this guide attempts to solve, not just logistically, but mentally and spiritually too. This book was not only practical and full of excellent guidance on how to discover oneself and stay safe in a world that is slowly throwing off the chains of sexual oppression, but it also looks at making peace within ourselves, setting boundaries, making sure we are able to identify our liberation from our wounds and treating others with tolerance and respect. It is not afraid to talk about the things that are still considered to be taboo. The narrator is spirited, authentic and hilarious, making difficult topics relatable and understandable.",

Crucially, she explains exactly how schools can achieve this.",

        "description": "A major new biography-an extraordinary, penetrating study of the man who has become the personification of evil. For all the literature about Adolf Hitler there have been just four seminal biographies; this is the fifth, a landmark work that sheds important new light on Hitler himself. Drawing on previously unseen papers and a wealth of recent scholarly research, Volker Ullrich reveals the man behind the public persona, from Hitler's childhood to his failures as a young man in Vienna to his experiences during the First World War to his rise as a far-right party leader. Ullrich deftly captures Hitler's intelligence, instinctive grasp of politics, and gift for oratory as well as his megalomania, deep insecurity, and repulsive worldview. Many previous biographies have focused on the larger social conditions that explain the rise of the Third Reich. Ullrich gives us a comprehensive portrait of a postwar Germany humiliated by defeat, wracked by political crisis, and starved by an economic depression, but his real gift is to show vividly how Hitler used his ruthlessness and political talent to shape the Nazi party and lead it to power. For decades the world has tried to grasp how Hitler was possible. By focusing on the man at the center of it all, on how he experienced his world, formed his political beliefs, and wielded power, this riveting biography brings us closer than ever to the answer. Translated from the German by Jefferson Chase.",

The WBC is fervently anti-gay, anti-Semitic, and anti- practically everything and everyone.

        "description": "\"In these uncertain times engulfed by clouds of doubts, suspicion, panic, lack of scientific and logical thinking, and inability to plan even for the near future, I have opted to decipher some haunting mysteries, de-obscure the overall foggy situation, and disengage the alleged conflict between science and quackery. Although we are still in the \"crawling\" stage to come at grips with the virus, we have a thousand-year repertoire of common sense, hundreds of years of development in preserving public health, and decades of evidence-based medicine. This book simplifies scientific terminology for the non-specialist reader. It succinctly focuses on straightforward practical information: no profuse introductions, no enigmatic theories, and no boring details that may repel you, unnecessarily prolong the book, or restrict the required diversity to review all aspects of dealing with the pandemic in everyday life. In terms of references and sources, I often refer to verified and credible general media sources rather than specialized references. This is to facilitate cross-reference by the reader and go through the same language and terms the general public understand. As healthcare professionals, we are both debtors and creditors. We owe it to all humankind to guide them in terms of awareness, education, care, treatment, and scientific research during this dreaded pandemic. However, they also owe us to listen to what we say, read what we write, and trust us. They should not surrender their ears, eyes, and minds to the mongers of deceit, addicts to conspiracy theories, idiots of limited intelligence, and advocates of political and commercial agendas that run counter to professionalism, knowledge, honesty, and credibility.\"",

        "description": "The Great Endurance is a powerful true story about an eight-year-old boy who is robbed of his virginity, his innocence, and the priceless treasure that protected it. He continues to search for the truth of who he is. Hope is needed to help him cope through the hardships that follows the abuse he faces. But, instead of hope, he is greeted with deep-despair, guilt, depression, anxiety, and fear on a daily basis until suicide behests the ending of his life. Unfortunately, family and friends cannot hear the silent cries of his heart, and unknowingly, he slowly begins to fade away. Who will save him from the thief who marked his territory and left behind seeds of torment and shame? The paths that he chooses along his journey leads to many dead-ends. Yet, no matter what he faces, he presses through it all with strength and integrity because he truly believes that everything will be alright.Having to fight off a sexual addiction can be compared to an attempt at overcoming any other hardcore addiction, i.e., drugs or alcohol. The struggles are realistic and the challenges of life become too overwhelming. Endurance is the key to survival. How will the young boy manage to make it through the disturbing-chaos that follows him into his adulthood? This book was not written to personally expose anyone. It was written to prove there are secrets and hidden truths that exists within all of us. What it takes to be victorious over our past and life&#8217;s circumstances lives within us all. We have what it takes to win! It is our personal perspectives of life itself that enables us to strive and successfully embrace the lasting benefits of The Great Endurance.",

        "description": "For students 13 through college graduation, Christine Reidhead's guide to building study skills is an extremely important book for those who want to secure their future through good grades. Too many students' grades are falling, especially in a time when regular classrooms cannot fully open. Parents everywhere are at a loss regarding what to do with their responsibilities in the face of the increasing downturn in their children's grades. It seems as though, with the advent of social media, the attention of a lot of students has been shifted from their books to their smartphones or computers. Apart from social media, blame has also been put on a decline in the interest of students regarding education in general. Students, at the moment, do not have the motivation or zeal, as it seems, to even study. Good study habits, or skills, are solutions to the problems experienced by students. This has been true for a long time, but the world is changing rapidly, which also means that the tools employed during study have to be changed in order to keep up. This is especially true as a result of the covid-19 pandemic that has forced students to study and learn from home rather than in the classroom. E-Learning, or online learning, can be effective, but only if the student has the discipline and drive to succeed using the tools and materials they are provided by teachers. Without strong study skills the student will fall behind in the classroom. Online the failure to develop good study skills can be devastating, leading to an inability to achieve the success in life the student could otherwise achieve. This excellent guide walks students through skills and habits which a student, or a person, employs while studying in order to make the most out of the experience. The kind of skills employed by a person, whether good or bad, determines how successful they will be in the process of learning, and Reidhead shows how to understand study skills, discover what kind of learner you are, develop great study skills, avoid bad study habits, identify the best places to study, and how to keep up with Online Learning during the current ovid-19 pandemic. It also helps parents and students to identify when certain students are studying excessively, harming the effectiveness of their studying. This is a must book for students who want good grades. Both a guide and a self-help book, it can help any student of any age, middle school through graduate school, succeed in their classes whether they are held in a classroom or online.",

In addition to Glassco's readily available work, Brian Busby draws on pseudonymous writings published as a McGill student as well as unpublished and previously unknown poems, letters, and journal entries to detail a vibrant life while pulling back the curtain on Glassco's sexuality and unconventional tastes. In a lively account of a man given to deception, who took delight in hoaxes, Busby manages to substantiate many of the often unreliable statements Glassco made about his life and work. A Gentleman of Pleasure is a remarkable biography that captures the knowable truth about a fascinatingly complex and secretive man.",

Takaaki Kajita is a Japanese physicist who is well known for neutrino experiments at the Kamiokande and the even more outsized Super-Kamiokande.This volume of collected works of Kajita on neutrino oscillations provides a good glimpse into the rise of Asian research in the frontiers of neutrino physics. Japan is now a major force in the study of the three families of neutrinos. Much remains to be done to clarify the Dirac vs. Majorana nature of the neutrino, and the cosmological implications of the neutrino. The collected works of Kajita and his Super-Kamiokande group will leave an indelible footprint in the history of big and better science.Copyright of the cover image belongs to Kamioka Observatory, ICRR (Institute for Cosmic Ray Research), The University of Tokyo.",

        "description": "This booklet addresses the question, \"How can we provide a feasible, long term solution for the current serious problem troubling all Eurozone member countries? The author contends that this will be hardly achieved by traditional mainstream economics recipes, not only because these have in the past proved to be mere \"patches\" providing short term solutions, but because in this particular case, there is another new element nonexistent within previous fiat money environments. We refer to the element of sovereignty. The author contends that this is the fatal flaw of the Euro monetary system, which was conceived by politicians in search of a legacy, and by mainstream economists advising them, who did not realize the flaw or decided to sweep it under the rug. Amazingly, politicians in economically stronger countries are proposing to solve the problem by taking away yet more sovereignty from country members, in order to impose economic measures to governments in those countries suffering from acute recessionary forces. Aware of the limits and deficiencies wrought by government controlled money as well as the particular political challenges presented by having one sole currency spanning many independent countries in Europe, the author puts forth a proposal involving the issuance of a new supranational currency backed by a 100 percent gold reserve, circulating side-by-side with the local re-issued currencies (DM, Franc, Drachma, etc.) at variable rates of exchange. The author explains how the DLCCS-Dual Level Currency Competition System he proposes addresses the need some countries have to act asymmetrically vis-a-vis other Eurozone members, from an economic point of view.

Moreover, her sister had also escaped earlier and had vanished into China for years, prompting the author to go public with her story in the hope of finding her sister.",

The result, Flournoy says, is that there is a myth that Dallas's leaders have been largely fair, forward-thinking officials who built a city that work for all citizens. ",

        "description": "In 2003, an independent film called The Room - starring and written, produced, and directed by a mysteriously wealthy social misfit named Tommy Wiseau - made its disastrous debut in Los Angeles. Described by one reviewer as 'like getting stabbed in the head', the $6 million film earned a grand total of $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Over a decade later, The Room is an international cult phenomenon, whose legions of fans attend screenings featuring costumes, audience rituals, merchandising and thousands of plastic spoons. In The Disaster Artist, Greg Sestero, Tommy's costar, recounts the film's bizarre journey to infamy, explaining how the movie's many nonsensical scenes and bits of dialogue came to be and unraveling the mystery of Tommy Wiseau himself. But more than just a riotously funny story about cinematic hubris, The Disaster Artist is an honest and warm testament to friendship.",

Fatima Alexander journeys through the horror of an abusive relationship, twenty years of depression, and a seemingly endless downward spiral. When it appears she's in the bottom of her own personal abyss, she finds purpose in the task of sharing her story, realizing she can help others understand that they are not alone in their pain and there is a way out of even the worst predicament. The Faith of Hannah is the honest testimony of the author's descent into despair, as well as the inspiring tale of how she finds freedom from her guilt and low sense of self-worth. Filled with relevant scripture and practical exercises, this book is an interactive guide that will help readers discover who they really are and start believing in a life that has meaning and value. For those who are up to the challenge, this volume will be a life-changing tool that allows them to embrace both the transcendent and the devastating in the story.",

        "description": "\"Magic Talks\" is a collection of letters between the two sisters, who are the founders of The Elf Queen's Daughters (in 1973), Arwen and Elanor, and The Silver Elves, Zardoa and Silver Flame. This is the first book in a series of Tulku Internet correspondence beginning in November of 2011 and ending in February 2012. Arwen and Elanor are also the original publishers of the \"Magic Elf Letters\" sent out from the Elf Queen's Daughters. They published three letters a week for about three years. In the early 1979 the Silver Elves carried on these letters calling them \"The Magical Elven Love Letters\" and continued writing and publishing them for the next 30 years, although on a much more whimsical schedule. There are a number of letters in \"Magic Talks\" discussing how Arwen and Elanor first started using the acute seven-pointed star as a symbol of the Elven people, passed on by Zardoa Silverstar, which has been adopted by elven and faerie folk all over the globe, and is called both the Elven Star and the Faerie Star. The letters contained in \"Magic Talks\" cover a wide range of topics from Tolkien to Sorcery, from Esoteric Buddhism and the Supra-dimensional to Elven Magic.",

When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it takes all of its experiences and everything that lives inside itself and transforms into a beautiful creature. What people don&#8217;t always notice is the metamorphosis - the isolation, the discomfort, even the pain. It&#8217;s usually all about the finished product. Well, imagine if the butterfly were able to go back and examine all of the moments that the caterpillar experienced in the process that shaped the finished product. This book is the butterfly&#8217;s opportunity to revisit, forgive, and even affirm the caterpillar from the other side.In this interactive journal, Terryca Taylor uses her personal experiences to take you through your own process of transformation and healing. You will be challenged to reflect and grow from what shaped you.",

But he's also been a witness to a medical culture that routinely leaves surgical sponges inside patients, amputates the wrong limbs, and overdoses children because of sloppy handwriting. Over the last ten years, neither error rates nor costs have come down, despite scientific progress and efforts to curb expenses. Why?",

Many people laughed and expressed to me that \"these\" people don't read, therefore how was I going to reach my target audience? It was at that moment that I realized that I had to complete Colored Money immediately. I realized that I needed to keep the content simple, straightforward, and to the point. I broke the content of Colored Money into two parts. The first part of Colored Money is the KNOWLEDGE side, and the second part is the ACTION PLAN. I separated the content into these two parts to allow the reader to easily reference different parts of the book as they start to acquire more and more assets while simultaneously showing the reader how to buy liabilities correctly. Throughout the course of Colored Money, we will discuss the difference between assets and liabilities. We will also discuss the different types of income and how they affect your financial freedom and your freedom of time. We will discuss alternatives to things that typically plaque lower income communities such as a lack of financial literacy and wasteful spending habits.It's time we break free from the challenges and circumstances that have been \"chained\" to our people and our families for generations by educating ourselves, our children, and our communities about money, wealth, and freedom. It starts with Colored Money.",

        "description": "In the early 2000s, a few years after becoming a democracy, South Africa saw the rise of a white separatist militia known as the Boeremag. Convinced that their existence was under threat, they devised a coup and planted bombs across the country while evading the authorities. This book chronicles the longest running criminal trial in South African history, piecing together court transcripts and interviews through in-depth journalism to explore the dynamics and ideals at the source of the movement and the coup. A firsthand look is offered at the dark consequences of nationalism and populism.",

It is the gritty testimony of a child struggling to come to terms with his own feelings and thoughts, with his nearest and dearest, and with the world around. The quest becomes a meaningful and empowering statement of self-belief and self-discovery, as in the end, the sworn-enemy siblings turn out to be the best of friends throughout their teenage and, really, for the rest of their lives. The autobiographical recount gently and seamlessly seeps into fantasy, bringing to the forefront the charming story of a duckling and his family. An unmissable must-read!",

        "description": "The Hymns of the Last Twilight is a collection of poetry in which the poet combines elements of nature with his own sense of loss and exile. The poet&#8217;s selection of beautiful images creates a distant land of aesthetic pleasure. It is divided into three parts; Memories, Longing and Confessions. Each part contains a number of poems. The spontaneous outpouring of nostalgia defines the general tenor of the poems contained in the first section, Memories. The deep sense of loss of the sweet and happy days spent in the communion of Nature as well as in the company of the beloved ones characterizes the recurring theme of the Memories. The pang of grief and agony keeps haunting the very psyche of the poet and a nice piece of poetry emerges out of it. The second section, Longing, too, expresses the poet&#8217;s sense of personal loss of romantic love. He feels agonized when he finds that he is not one with his beloved. Some undefined powers have set them apart to suffer the trauma. But still he finds solace in the world of his own imagination. In the last stanza of his poem Let those Birds Sing, for instance, an optimistic voice is heard: &#8220;For reasons we do sometimes migrate/ When seasons do change in time, my dear! / But time and space are none, I state / Our souls by love are linked forever&#8221;. The last section, Confessions, is markedly imprinted on the poet&#8217;s consciousness. He acutely feels the festering wounds of his beloved country &#8211; strife-torn, thoroughly devastated, shorn of all values, only mad and blind pursuit for achieving nothing and pushing it into abyss of total destruction, everlasting gloom. To the poet, the world is totally fragmented, scattered and broken into pieces.",

        "description": "There are many reasons why neural networks fascinate us and have captivated headlines in recent years. They make web searches better, organize photos, and are even used in speech translation. Heck, they can even generate encryption. At the same time, they are also mysterious and mind-bending: how exactly do they accomplish these things ? What goes on inside a neural network? On a high level, a network learns just like we do, through trial and error. This is true regardless if the network is supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. Once we dig a bit deeper though, we discover that a handful of mathematical functions play a major role in the trial and error process. It also becomes clear that a grasp of the underlying mathematics helps clarify how a network learns. In the following chapters we will unpack the mathematics that drive a neural network. To do this, we will use a feedforward network as our model and follow input as it moves through the network.",

        "description": "Scientists are, all the time, in a struggle with uncertainty which is always a threat to a trustworthy scientific knowledge. A very simple and natural idea, to defeat uncertainty, is that of enclosing uncertain measured values in real closed intervals. On the basis of this idea, interval arithmetic is constructed. The idea of calculating with intervals is not completely new in mathematics: the concept has been known since Archimedes, who used guaranteed lower and upper bounds to compute his constant Pi. Interval arithmetic is now a broad field in which rigorous mathematics is associated with scientific computing. This connection makes it possible to solve uncertainty problems that cannot be efficiently solved by floating-point arithmetic. Today, application areas of interval methods include electrical engineering, control theory, remote sensing, experimental and computational physics, chaotic systems, celestial mechanics, signal processing, computer graphics, robotics, and computer-assisted proofs. The purpose of this book is to be a concise but informative introduction to the theories of interval arithmetic as well as to some of their computational and scientific applications.",

        "description": "Born from the wave of activism that followed the inauguration of President Trump, Demand the Impossible asks scholars what they can do to help solve present-day crises. The twelve essays in this volume draw inspiration from present-day activists. They examine the role of history in shaping ongoing debates over monuments, racism, clean energy, health care, poverty, and the Democratic Party. Together they show the ways that the issues of today are historical expressions of power that continue to shape the present. Adequately addressing them means understanding their origins.",

        "description": "If Not ObamaCare, Then what? Critics of ObamaCare (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) have not been united in proposing a suitable alternative. The author, Dr. Fred F. Hollingsworth, has the solution. His plan is presented in Chapter 10 of his book which is reviewed below. This plan will lower costs considerably while greatly increasing the quality of healthcare. Very powerful national and international financial interests have controlled healthcare for several decades. Their motive is mainly profit. Very little money is made by getting people well and keeping them well. Much money is made by keeping people sick but alive. The term \"healthcare\" is not actually correct. It should be called \"sickness care.\" Any health product or therapy, no matter how effective, is thus rejected if it is not profitable. Doctors, who attempt to use any unapproved lifesaving treatments to heal patients, face prosecution, the loss of their licenses, jail, financial bankruptcy, the loss of their health, and sometimes their actual physical safety. The above noted financial powers have long controlled the media and have built a gigantic propaganda machine to indoctrinate the public continuously to believe that various lifesaving products and therapies, are in fact fraudulent and constitute quackery. The public is, instead, led strongly but erroneously to believe that good health depends substantially upon the liberal use of expensive prescription drugs and surgeries. Furthermore the public is led to believe many untrue beliefs which are damaging to health. ______________________________________ A Review by Dr. Morton Walker 9-7-2012 Dr. Fred blows the lid off the health care scandal--the crime of the century with far more victims (believe it or not) than resulted from the terrible Nazi Holocaust. Tens of millions of people have watched precious dear loved ones suffer pain and ill health for decades ultimately dying long before reaching old age. Meanwhile many lifesaving healing therapies and products have been suppressed. A few examples include: Infections can be eliminated inexpensively and effectively without the use of antibiotics. Cardiovascular health can usually be restored without dangerous and expensive surgery. Dozens of effective inexpensive cancer cures are known. Type 1 (juvenile onset ) Diabetes M. can be overcome without insulin. Alzheimer's disease can even be reversed inexpensively. Furthermore, Dr. Fred exposes several popular false beliefs, concerning health and nutrition, which have contributed to people's poor health and early death. Learn who is responsible for this outrageous and intolerable situation and how tyranny has been used to repress freedom and prevent these inexpensive and unprofitable lifesaving treatments from being used by mainstream medicine. Become aware of how government leaders attempt to address these problems while they appear not to know that government itself is the cause. Armed with the health and political information in this book, the reader should gain the opportunity to live a longer and more productive life--free of pain and illness while spending little for healthcare--and, thus, also help to prevent countless numbers of devastating government and private bankrupties. All of this and much more is explained in this 340 page easy-to-read must read book which presents a plan for far more effective healthcare at much less cost. It is available at WWW.Createspace.com/3618670 at $18.95 plus shipping. Reorders are $12.95.",

        "description": "No doubt, history is littered with theories and beliefs that not only proved to be wrong in the end, but also costly as far as the human search for truth and development is concerned. The view that the Earth was the physical and the biological center of the Universe was one such failed theory, one that cost many famous scientists most of their lives, and held back societies everywhere for decades or hundreds of years behind what is now considered a given truth. In the current work under consideration, religion and evolution theories come under scrutiny in light of recent scientific facts that dispute their most important claims about the origins of the species. In The True Story of Human Evolutionary Genesis, Elvis Newman presents both astounding facts and findings about the human genome, as well as paradigm-shifting theories emanating from Zecharia Sitchin's work around the Sumerian clay tablets. About the Author A futurist researcher with an MBA, Elvis Newman has worked as a ghost writer and researcher for well-known new age and futurist gurus of our times. He professes to insatiable interests in humanity's progress into the future and past lessons from history, because we all know that our most outrageous imaginations of the past will quickly become our most indispensable realities.

        "description": "To the Survivors is about one man&#8217;s journey as a rape crisis counselor with true stories of sexual violence shared by survivors in their own words. Gently and beautifully constructed, To the Survivors is moving, tender, sharp, and piercingly true all at once. Readers will encounter uncensored written stories, poems, and interviews from women and men who have experienced rape and sexual assault, plus the advocate-author voice that weaves their experiences together. The survivors are diverse in age, gender, and ethnicity, yet each gives a similarity raw and heartfelt account of his or her victimization and recovery. The authenticity and vulnerability with which survivors speak resonates profoundly. But this book is not just for survivors of sexual violence. Robert Uttaro believes anyone can benefit from the words in these pages, rape survivor or not.",

        "description": "Gender has now become a pervasive topic in the humanities and social sciences. Yet despite its familiarity within universities and colleges, some have argued that the radical debates which first characterized gender studies have become ghettoized or marginalized - so that gender no longer makes the impact on creative thinking and ideas that it once did. Brooke Holmes here rescues ancient ideas about sex and gender in order precisely to reinvigorate contemporary debate. She argues that much writing on gender in the classical age fails to place those ancient ideas within their proper historical contexts. As a result, the full transformational force of that thinking is often overlooked. In this short, lively book, the author offers a sophisticated and historically rounded reading of gender in antiquity in order to map out the future of contemporary gender studies. By re-examining ancient notions of sexual difference, bodies, culture, and identity, Holmes shows that Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Epicureans and others force us to reassess what is at stake in present-day discussions about gender. The ancient world thus offers a vital resource for modern gender theory.",

He faced metastatic cancer by living fully for the rest of his days. When treatments beat him down, Dad set small physical goals and systematically met them. Time and again, his doctors preserved the human body where the tumors grew, until there was nothing more they could do to prevent the inevitable. But Dad didn't feel like dying. He felt full of life and longing to live. He was angry and sad, disappointed and confused, scared and brave, unaccepting and, finally, accepting. With courage and amazing grace, he lovingly prepared our family for his passing. As our time together came to an end, I was grateful to be present. Although death is an inevitable part of life, how we choose to be-with the dying and the bereaved is up to us. I encourage you to prepare and to embrace the possibility of a lovingly supported transition and, to that end, I include some resources that may assist you. Being ready to be-with is a wonderful way to live.",

        "description": "In this book, appropriately titled &#8216;Til Death Do Us Part, the reader may identify with the compassion of one care giver in comparison with the brutality of the disease itself. Hopefully it will enlighten and offer support to those in need. When I think of who my mother was in her prime, and who she became in the end, it&#8217;s like imagining two different people. She too was a graduate from nursing school in 1943. Care giving was natural for her. She came from a large family of seven children who worked hard on their farm to make ends meet. She helped provide for the family and took care of her younger siblings. She enjoyed working in the hospital and felt at ease among the halls of medicine. She never would have wanted her life to become so dependent upon others but unfortunately, her nurturing role was reversed. My father stepped into the role of care giver for 15 years as she helplessly became the unwilling recipient. My greatest hope for today is to spread awareness of the disease and support extensive research for the promise of a cure once and for all.",

        "description": "How did women contribute to the rise of the Mongol Empire while Mongol men were conquering Eurasia? This book positions women in their rightful place in the otherwise well-known story of Chinggis Khan (commonly known as Genghis Khan) and his conquests and empire. Examining the best known women of Mongol society, such as Chinggis Khan's mother, H&#65533;'el&#65533;n, and senior wife, B&#65533;rte, as well as those who were less famous but equally influential, including his daughters and his conquered wives, we see the systematic and essential participation of women in empire, politics and war. Anne F. Broadbridge also proposes a new vision of Chinggis Khan's well-known atomized army by situating his daughters and their husbands at the heart of his army reforms, looks at women's key roles in Mongol politics and succession, and charts the ways the descendants of Chinggis Khan's daughters dominated the Khanates that emerged after the breakup of the Empire in the 1260s.",

Lincoln found the solace and tactics he needed to deal with the nation's worst crisis in the coping strategies he developed over a lifetime of persevering through depressive episodes and personal tragedies. With empathy and authority gained from his own experience with depression, Shenk crafts a nuanced, revelatory account of Lincoln and his legacy, and in the process unveils a wholly new perspective on how our greatest president guided America through its greatest turmoil.",

Far from inheriting the throne, the orphaned boy-king had to endure the hostility and abuse of a nation. Two years later, the revolutionary leaders declared the young Louis XVII dead, prompting rumors of murder. No grave was dug, no monument built to mark his passing. Soon thereafter, the theory circulated that the prince had in fact escaped from prison and was still alive. Others believed that he had been killed, his heart preserved as a relic. The quest for the truth continued into the twenty-first century when, thanks to DNA testing, a stolen heart found within the royal tombs brought an exciting conclusion to the two-hundred-year-old mystery.",

        "description": "In this vibrant biography, acclaimed author Alison Weir reexamines the life of Isabella of England, one of history&#8217;s most notorious and charismatic queens. Isabella arrived in London in 1308, the spirited twelve-year-old daughter of King Philip IV of France. Her marriage to the heir to England&#8217;s throne was designed to heal old political wounds between the two countries, and in the years that followed she became an important figure, a determined and clever woman whose influence would come to last centuries. Many myths and legends have been woven around Isabella&#8217;s story, but in this first full biography in more than 150 years, Alison Weir gives a groundbreaking new perspective.",

        "description": "NOT JUST ANOTHER DIET BOOK The failing of most \"weight loss\" books is that they are strict, regimented plans complete with recipes, rules and long, long lists of do's and don'ts. This approach is exactly what Chicago author Laura Dion-Jones challenges and changes in her revolutionary new book, Commit To Get Fit: Find the Secret to Your Own True and Everlasting Weight Loss. Rather than continuing to bombard readers with one more rigid program aimed at weight loss, Laura simply aims to inspire and change the reader's approach to weight control through a detailed, self-effacing, fun-filled and yet poignant journey of her own success. The book includes insights, thought processes and other information detailed during her journey to a healthier lifestyle, all of which are intended to positively influence the reader's view on his or her own attempts at weight loss. It also, while remaining entertaining and positive, stays realistic. Rather than make claims about some secret \"trick\" that magically transforms your body, as is too rampant in the weight loss industry, it details both Laura's successes and mistakes, her moments of gratification and of disappointment, which make for a guide that is as honest as it is refreshing. One reader review of an advance copy of Commit To Get Fit has described the book as \"careful to skewer the diet industry, entertainingly, from the beginning\" and \"a valuable read for anyone who wants to lose weight, particularly if you have tried and tried and have given up the ghost on that particular goal.\" One of Laura's goals in writing Commit To Get Fit was to change the way dieters view the process of losing weight by taking control of their own personal lifestyle, rather than following guidelines and those rigid rules that could possibly be unhealthy or not suitable for each and every individual. And putting an end to our country's obesity epidemic because being over weight is not a disease. Obesity is totally and unequivocally preventable. It all comes down to choice and personal responsibility. Period.",

Beginning with the River Thames, she examines the city on the north bank, still largely confined within the old Roman walls. The wealthy lived in mansions upriver, and the royal palaces were even farther up at Westminster. On the south bank, theaters and spectacles drew the crowds, and Southwark and Bermondsey were bustling with trade. Picard examines the streets and the traffic in them; she surveys building methods and shows us the decor of the rich and the not-so-rich. Her account overflows with particulars of domestic life, right down to what was likely to be growing in London gardens.",

The neuroscience we read about in magazines, newspaper articles, books, and sometimes even scientific journals increasingly tells a tale of two brains, and the result is more often than not a validation of the status quo.

Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy",

        "description": "Elizabeth was crowned queen at twenty-five, but it was only when she reached fifty and all hopes of a royal marriage were behind her that she began to wield power in her own right. For twenty-five years she had struggled to assert her authority over advisers, who pressed her to marry and settle the succession; now, she was determined not only to reign but to rule. In this magisterial biography, John Guy introduces us to a woman who is refreshingly unfamiliar: at once powerful and vulnerable, willful and afraid. We see her confronting challenges at home and abroad: war against France and Spain, revolt in Ireland, an economic crisis that triggers riots in the streets of London, and a conspiracy to place her cousin Mary Queen of Scots on her throne. For a while she is smitten by a much younger man, but can she allow herself to act on that passion and still keep her throne? ",

They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress--with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.",

        "description": "Between 1958 and 1962, China descended into hell. Mao Zedong threw his country into a frenzy with the Great Leap Forward, an attempt to catch up and overtake Britain in less than 15 years. The experiment ended in the greatest catastrophe the country had ever known, destroying tens of millions of lives. Access to Communist Party archives has long been denied to all but the most loyal historians, but now a new law has opened up thousands of central and provincial documents that fundamentally change the way one can study the Maoist era. Frank Dikotter's astonishing, riveting and magnificently detailed book chronicles an era in Chinese history much speculated about but never before fully documented. Dikotter shows that instead of lifting the country among the world's superpowers and proving the power of communism, as Mao imagined, in reality the Great Leap Forward was a giant - and disastrous -- step in the opposite direction. He demonstrates, as nobody has before, that under this initiative the country became the site not only of one of the most deadly mass killings of human history (at least 45 million people were worked, starved or beaten to death) but also the greatest demolition of real estate - and catastrophe for the natural environment - in human history, as up to a third of all housing was turned to rubble and the land savaged in the maniacal pursuit of steel and other industrial accomplishments. Piecing together both the vicious machinations in the corridors of power and the everyday experiences of ordinary people, Dikotter at last gives voice to the dead and disenfranchised. Exhaustively researched and brilliantly written, this magisterial, groundbreaking account definitively recasts the history of the People's Republic of China.",

The men who were the Leafs in 1967--a scrappy group of aging players and unsung youngsters--were the kings of this universe, the last hockey heroes to skate in the world's most important hockey city. They were the men with the right stuff who enjoyed the perks and privileges that went with it.",

        "description": "Long before reality television shows like Survivor, some people walked across the United States and Europe to Russia on real-life, Survivor-like projects. This is the inside story of one of those break-down-the-walls projects during the height of the 1980s Cold War by a journalist trained to be as objective as possible. The walk was covered by more than 2,000 newspapers and other media outlets. The participants met officials in all countries, including Russia, in an effort to get them to reverse the arms race and work together for the good of humanity. Walking through the Wall details the sometimes intense internal conflicts of this project and others. The book covers the dangers that included one participant of a 1987-88 march in India being hit by a bus and almost dying. It is a timeless story of not just trying to walk through barriers like the Berlin Wall, but of attempting to break through internal walls, unseen walls between fellow human beings, walls between one's self.",

And in 2014, Ukrainian revolutionaries raided the palace of their ousted president and found a zoo of peacocks, gilded toilets, and a floating restaurant modeled after a Spanish galleon. Unlikely as it might seem, there is a thread connecting these events, and Rachel Maddow follows it to its crooked source: the unimaginably lucrative and equally corrupting oil and gas industry.",

David Bentley Hart provides a bold correction of the New Atheists&#8217; misrepresentations of the Christian past, countering their polemics with a brilliant account of Christianity and its message of human charity as the most revolutionary movement in all of Western history.",

By analyzing the lives of such past masters as Charles Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Leonard da Vinci, as well as by interviewing nine contemporary masters, including tech guru Paul Graham and animal rights advocate Temple Grandin, Greene debunks our culture&#8217;s many myths about genius and distills the wisdom of the ages to reveal the secret to greatness.

The book is well researched and presents an overview of the track record of the two major parties. 5 stars\" (Maria Beltran, Readers' Favorite). Over the past few decades, the country has become highly divided politically. In the course of reporting current events, the concepts of conservative and liberal have become grossly distorted. At the top of a political agenda is the demonization of the opposition party. The true accomplishments and values have been suppressed. If this is not corrected, government will continue toward an abyss of dysfunction, disunity, and dissension. It is paramount that the US electorate is accurately and fully informed regarding the record of liberals and conservatives, hence this book. The author was a spacecraft engineer on NASA's Apollo program and a computer science instructor at California State University. He holds a master's degree in systems engineering from the University of California and has traveled extensively through Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Among his accomplishments are ascending Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Everest and photographing total solar eclipses around the world. Living on the beach in Southern California, he is involved in managing his real estate investments, writing, and spending time with his grown children and his grandsons. http: //cyberia-quest.net/BucketList2017/BUCKET-LIST2...",

        "description": "\"America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy\"--John Quincy Adams's famous words are often quoted to justify noninterference in other nations' affairs. Yet when he spoke them, Adams was not advocating neutrality or passivity but rather outlining a national policy that balanced democratic idealism with a pragmatic understanding of the young republic's capabilities and limitations. America's rise from a confederation of revolutionary colonies to a world power is often treated as inevitable, but Charles N. Edel's provocative biography of Adams argues that he served as the central architect of a grand strategy that shaped America's rise. Adams's particular combination of ideas and policies made him a critical link between the founding generation and the Civil War-era nation of Lincoln.",

Providing pathbreaking readings of Heidegger's The Origin of the Work of Art and his notoriously difficult Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), this book explains precisely what postmodernity meant for Heidegger, the greatest philosophical critic of modernity, and what it could still mean for us today. Exploring these issues, Iain D. Thomson examines several postmodern works of art, including music, literature, painting, and even comic books, from a post-Heideggerian perspective. Clearly written and accessible, this book will help readers gain a deeper understanding of Heidegger and his relation to postmodern theory, popular culture, and art.\"",

        "description": "From the author of Binding Chaos, this book brings us back to the beginning. The beginning of designing a better method of governance and way of living is to look at the structure of our self. The scope and originality of this book present a radical challenge to a seldom examined worldview. With an extremely wide reach and richness of detail, The Creation of Me, Them and Us sets the stage for further discussions of institutional reform by tackling the fundamental questions of who are we, what do we want, and why do we act the way we do? These questions (and answers) are fundamental in understanding a world that may seem incomprehensible today.",

How is an achievement of this magnitude to be explained? How did Shakespeare become Shakespeare? Stephen Greenblatt brings us down to earth to see, hear, and feel how an acutely sensitive and talented boy, surrounded by the rich tapestry of Elizabethan life, could have become the world's greatest playwright.

        "description": "A leading authority on the late Roman Empire and on the barbarians, Heather relates the extraordinary story of how Europe's barbarians, transformed by centuries of contact with Rome on every possible level, eventually pulled the empire apart. He shows first how the Huns overtuned the existing strategic balance of power on Rome's European frontiers to force the Goths and others to seek refuge inside the empire. This prompted two generations of struggle, during which new barbarian coalitions, formed in response to Roman hostility, brought the Roman west to its knees. The Goths first destroyed a Roman army at the battle of Hadrianople in 378 and went on to sack Rome in 410. The Vandals spread devastation in Gaul and Spain befor conquering North Africa, the breadbasket of the western empire, in 439. We then meet Attila the Hun, whose reign of terror swept from Constantinople to Paris, but whose death in 453 ironically precipitated a final desperate phase of Roman collapse, culminating in the Vandals' defeat of the massive Byzantine Armada, the west's last change for survival.",

        "description": "Pompeii is the most famous archaeological site in the world, visited by more than two million people each year. Yet it is also one of the most puzzling, with an intriguing and sometimes violent history, from the sixth century BCE to the present day. Destroyed by Vesuvius in 79 CE, the ruins of Pompeii offer the best evidence we have of life in the Roman Empire. But the eruptions are only part of the story. In The Fires of Vesuvius, acclaimed historian Mary Beard makes sense of the remains. She explores what kind of town it was--more like Calcutta or the Costa del Sol?--and what it can tell us about ordinary life there. From sex to politics, food to religion, slavery to literacy, Beard offers us the big picture even as she takes us close enough to the past to smell the bad breath and see the intestinal tapeworms of the inhabitants of the lost city. She resurrects the Temple of Isis as a testament to ancient multiculturalism. At the Suburban Baths we go from communal bathing to hygiene to erotica. Recently, Pompeii has been a focus of pleasure and loss: from Pink Floyd's memorable rock concert to Primo Levi's elegy on the victims. But Pompeii still does not give up its secrets quite as easily as it may seem. This book shows us how much more and less there is to Pompeii than a city frozen in time as it went about its business on 24 August 79.",

If there was ever a need for political representation or a paternalistic and opaque authority, it has been removed by technology. Every political system we have tried has proven incapable of protecting human rights and dignity. Every political system we have tried has devolved into oligarchy. To effect the change we require immediately, to give individuals control and responsibility, to bring regional systems under regional governance, allow global collaboration and protect the heritage of future generations, we need a new political model.",

Amid ambivalence and uncertainty, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, George Shultz, George H. W. Bush, and a host of other actors engaged with adversaries and adapted to a rapidly changing international environment and information age in which global capitalism recovered as command economies failed.",

Through narrative that is alternately heartbreaking and fiercely funny, we are drawn into a daughter's complex yearning for her father. And yet, apart from assigned stints dusting caskets at the family-owned \"fun home,\" as Alison and her brothers call it, the relationship achieves its most intimate expression through the shared code of books. When Alison comes out as homosexual herself in late adolescense, the denouement is swift, graphic -- and redemptive.",

It was also a land withered by drought and hunger, and a place where hope and opportunity were hard to find. But William had read about windmills in a book called Using Energy, and he dreamed of building one that would bring electricity and water to his village and change his life and the lives of those around him. His neighbors may have mocked him and called him misala&#8212;crazy&#8212;but William was determined to show them what a little grit and ingenuity could do.",

But the surprising truth is that Genghis Khan was a visionary leader whose conquests joined backward Europe with the flourishing cultures of Asia to trigger a global awakening, an unprecedented explosion of technologies, trade, and ideas. In Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, Jack Weatherford, the only Western scholar ever to be allowed into the Mongols&#8217; &#8220;Great Taboo&#8221;&#8212;Genghis Khan&#8217;s homeland and forbidden burial site&#8212;tracks the astonishing story of Genghis Khan and his descendants, and their conquest and transformation of the world.

All too often he is caricatured as a chronic loser and inept businessman, fond of drinking to excess; or as the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War; or as a credulous and hapless president whose tenure came to symbolize the worst excesses of the Gilded Age. These stereotypes don't come close to capturing adequately his spirit and the sheer magnitude of his monumental accomplishments. A biographer at the height of his powers, Chernow has produced a portrait of Grant that is a masterpiece, the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortunes rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency.",

Long before Stonewall and Gay Pride, there was such a thing as gay culture, and it was recognized throughout Europe and America. Graham Robb, brilliant biographer of Balzac, Hugo, and Rimbaud, examines how homosexuals were treated by society and finds a tale of surprising tolerance. He describes the lives of gay men and women: how they discovered their sexuality and accepted or disguised it; how they came out; how they made contact with like-minded people. He also includes a fascinating investigation of the encrypted homosexuality of such famous nineteenth-century sleuths as Edgar Allan Poe's Auguste Dupin and Sherlock Holmes himself (with glances forward in time to Batman and J. Edgar Hoover). Finally, ",

This was the England of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Bacon; the era of the Gunpowder Plot and the worst outbreak of the plague. Jacobean England was both more godly and less godly than the country had ever been, and the entire culture was drawn taut between these polarities. This was the world that created the King James Bible. It is the greatest work of English prose ever written, and it is no coincidence that the translation was made at the moment \"Englishness,\" specifically the English language itself, had come into its first passionate maturity. The English of Jacobean England has a more encompassing idea of its own scope than any form of the language before or since. It drips with potency and sensitivity.

The reason for this is also not hard to find: as it does now, 'love' in the ancient world meant the affection of equals, and given the inferior position of women in Greek and Roman society, between the sexes is not usually where love is to be found.",
